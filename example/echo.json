Her undying, almost sublime appetite for destruction has real bite—as in, she'll eat just about anything. The slightest movement from her makes others break out in a cold sweat, and yet no one dislikes her. This is apparently thanks to the simplistic, almost child-like joy she takes in what she does.",

Once other spirits—especially female spirits—found out about this her reputation skyrocketed, and she now operates as both a collector and buyer.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Romance of the Demon and Sword</color>",
        "278" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"What do you wanna put in?\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of a chest used to gather items in anticipation of married life.</color> She's so powerful that she can lift her wooden chest weighing many times more than herself with a single hand. She's also a bit of a hoarder, gathering things left and right and cramming them into her beloved chest. She'll put anything in there—literally ANYTHING—and people are starting to wonder when it's going to get full. But she doesn't seem to harbor any such concerns. Let's just say her chest contains many secrets...<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Romance of the Demon and Sword</color>",
        "279" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"Oh, mine are the absolute best!\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of a swordsmith who produced many of the world's most famous swords.</color> Dojigiri Yasutsuna is perhaps one of his most famous works. He dotes on his creations like his own children, causing them no end of trouble in the process. That's because his version of \"doting\" is more like butting in and meddling in their affairs. Still, they respect him like a father...to a certain degree, at least.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Romance of the Demon and Sword</color>",
        "280" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"My husband should be here any minute...\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of the goddess of marriage, motherhood and chastity.</color> She's bothered by her husband's freewheeling behavior, and consequently their marriage has numerous problems. But it never completely falls apart thanks in large part to her tolerance. There are rumors that she arranged for a special familiar to keep an eye on him at all times, but she shrugs off such false accusations with a broad smile. Because they're definitely false and not true in any way. Ahem.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Romance of the Demon and Sword</color>",
        "281" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"I d-don't like getting all dressed up!\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of one of the Five Swords under Heaven, known for killing demons.</color> Her feelings for Shuten Doji have helped her grow into a new woman. She also seems to have taken to care about her appearance, constantly admiring herself whenever she passes by a mirror. Their ceremony was never actually held, but, despite the outcome she was still very happy they reaffirmed their feelings for one another. And, after everything was said and done, she apparently made off with the wedding dress and all the accessories, too.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Romance of the Demon and Sword</color>",
        "282" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"Yes, yes. I've already been made well aware.\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of the demon leader of Mount Oe.</color> His feelings for his beloved Dojigiri Yasutsuna triggered an evil energy outbreak, and they had to throw together a last-minute wedding to deal with it. Although there was no ceremony in the end, the two talked their feelings over, and reaffirmed their vows to make each other happy. He also vowed in secret to earn her father's approval before the day they really do get married.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Romance of the Demon and Sword</color>",
        "283" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"You wanna talk to little old me?\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of a cat that was once looked after by a certain master.</color> She eventually became a spirit after living for a very long time as a cat. She's fond of humans on account of a loving master. And, maybe also thanks to her old master, she has a slightly philosophical bent. She's good friends with Socrates, and they often discuss things at great length. Many philosophical concepts appear quite different from the perspective of a cat, so talking with her definitely makes you think about things in a new way.<br/><color=#94b5fe>[Special Bond] Increases normal ATK by {#MonsterName#84}.</color>",
        "284" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"I'm off the clock, so let's have some fun!\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of the demon of lust, one of the seven deadly sins.</color> He's also very well-known in the demon world as a male magazine model. His popularity even rivals that of Lucifer. However, he recently got tired of dealing with fans and secretly went to work at the Bureau of the Occult. He's apparently searching for people who will treat him not as a famous model but instead as just an average spirit. Still, when he does run into the inevitable fan he treats them with utmost respect, showing what a true professional he really is.",
        "285" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"Leave the chronically to me!\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of an illustrated scroll documenting marriages in the spirit world.</color> She tends to appear suddenly at weddings without being invited. She can instantaneously transfer everything she sees onto her scroll, so you don't have to worry whether she managed to capture a special moment—she definitely got it, and much more. However, she also records things in everyday life, even when you least expect it. It's not necessarily her intention, but she tends to record things that might be a tad shocking for the people involved. Thus many in the Bureau of the Occult have learned not to take her powers lightly.",
        "286" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"I think you could use a little test!\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of an angel that tests your faith.</color> She throws evil in people's path in order to test the extent of their faith and virtue. Perhaps it comes with the job, but she's quite cruel despite her angelic nature. Since she works with fallen angels a lot, people often mistake her for one, but she is in fact a fully fledged servant of heaven. So step out of line and you'd best watch your tongue.",
        "287" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"Can you handle the famous Sanada resolve?\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of a general considered the best warrior in Japan.</color> He became famous for putting his life on the line for the Toyotomi family he served, and he hasn't changed at all since becoming a spirit. Many spirits wish they could be like him, marching in alone and carving a path to success even when the chances of victory look slim. Currently he appears to be deeply indebted to Mikado... It's not clear why, but in any case he's not in any position to stand up to her.",
        "288" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"Gotta have my cucumbers!\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of a legendary Japanese creature that lives in lakes and rivers and loves cucumbers.</color> He's been spotted all over the country and is considered very influential, probably because humans have always felt a certain closeness to kappas. He is also an excellent judge of cucumbers. His sense of smell is probably better attuned to determining a cucumber's quality than it is to detecting nearby brutes.",
        "289" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"Not up for it? Can you at least give me some red juice?\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of a dead body that can move around without rotting.</color> Even before becoming a spirit she possessed incredible acrobatic powers, and now she can still leap around, ignoring the effects of rigor mortis. Apparently at one point there was a Jiangshi craze in Japan, which established her current appearance in people's minds. She was originally a vampire, but now she's a big fan of ketchup—although sometimes she drinks tomato juice instead. She gets happy at the sight of any red liquid, really.",

Sometimes she leaves people a little confused, though. And sometimes she takes the whole \"it'll all work out\" attitude a little too far, neglecting to take precautions for anything. But her carefree attitude is surprisingly popular with women.",

Now, since becoming a spirit, she's secretly taken up cooking as a hobby. She just loves entertaining guests with a meal of freshly caught fish. This has led her to spend a lot of time with other food-loving spirits and thus form many close friendships.<br/><color=#94b5fe>[Special Bond] Increases {#MonsterName#298}'s skill DMG.</color><br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Coastal Calamity - Tanabata Beach Contest</color>",

Considered young adult fiction by today's standards, it was met with great critical and popular acclaim, making him quite famous. It also helped him amass a small fortune, according to some sources.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Coastal Calamity - Tanabata Beach Contest</color>",

She used to love keeping an eye on them, but now she's just going through the motions. They seem to be falling into a regular day-to-day pattern...and growing a little complacent? Or maybe everything is going perfectly? In any case, she claims to be bored now that the bittersweetness is gone from the pair's interactions. Who knows how she really feels deep down inside, though...<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Coastal Calamity - Tanabata Beach Contest</color>",
        "295" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"Hey, where'd everyone go?\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of the turtle rescued by Urashima Taro.</color> She's the type to return any act of compassion, no matter how small. The catch is that she's super chill and tends to run behind schedule. Bearing a wish of her own, she joined the beach contest, but the other contestants quickly outpaced her. Nonetheless, many spirits respect her dedication and refusal to give up.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Coastal Calamity - Tanabata Beach Contest</color>",

        "297" : "<color=#f4e48e>\"The smoke was a nice touch, eh?\"</color><br/><color=#ef9843>The spirit of a box never meant to be opened.</color> An undersea official who pledges allegiance to Princess Oto, his deep love and respect for her leads him to join the beach contest to make her wish come true. He would gladly work even on his off days if she were to ask. This proactive attitude is his response to the many people who don't follow through with their promises. They inspire him to carry out his duties properly, even if he's the only one doing it.<br/><color=#f45d68>[Event] Coastal Calamity - Tanabata Beach Contest</color>",

Since eventually all of the world's delicacies end up there, he's decided to just wait for them to come to him. Despite his reputation as a gourmet, he isn't that picky about things like flavor profiles or ingredient quality.

        "59986" : "Wow, they put so much effort into this... It really makes me feel special.",
        "59502" : "Yes. We were sent here to prevent an evil energy outbreak from disrupting the exhibition, after all.",

        "59517" : "More importantly, our goal here is to keep YOU safe.",
        "60501" : "...Everything's ready for the venue-wide broadcast.",
        "59516" : "This is strictly business. Gender has nothing to do with it.",
        "60500" : "Huh...?",
        "59995" : "Looks like they've already started reading Snow White... And the kids look so into it!",
        "59511" : "Inspector Zenimaru, I'd like to ask you to handle the security...outside.",
        "59994" : "Well, we can't force her to do anything against her will. Let's just go on without her for now.",
        "59510" : "How big do you think these \"militias\" are, Master...?",
        "59997" : "Now, how far are they?",
        "59513" : "To be blunt, we're more familiar with the security system inside the building.",
        "59996" : "Check out that machine they've set up to do the reading. Pretty impressive!",
        "59512" : "H-hold on a minute! What do you mean?",
        "59519" : "I told you, I can protect myself! And \"business\" or not, I'll always stand up for women! That's just the kind of man I am!",
        "59518" : "So you should go back to your exhibition and leave the tough decisions to us.",
        "60070" : "Alllrighty then!\n...By the way, Snow White, how's your story? Have you gotten that all sorted?",

        "60073" : "Well... I do feel angry that children are being forced to have terrible experiences through my story...",
        "60072" : "No, no, we can't have that! Let's focus on your story first, then! You don't want children hearing the dark version, do you?",
        "60071" : "No...I'm afraid it's still under her spell.",
        "60081" : "Dorothy's starting to lose it! We have to help her before something bad happens!",

        "59483" : "I thought you were keeping an eye on the other building, de' Medici!",
        "59482" : "Who's with you, Zenimaru? Is that...de' Medici?!",
        "60479" : "If only she were here...! If Glassie Slipper was by my side, I know I could manage it!",
        "60478" : "In theory, yes... However, I wouldn't be able to perform such a feat in a venue this large on my own.",
        "59489" : "What...?! We trusted you because you said you were a specialist!",
        "60477" : "Cinderella's magic could make it so only spirits can hear it, am I right?",
        "59488" : "About that... Actually I've been too busy dealing with the evil brutes to do any actual investigating...",
        "60476" : "Take all the time you need. But when you're ready, you could use the PA system to make an announcement.",
        "60475" : "I'm not good at just speaking my mind like that... But maybe if I practice...?",
        "60474" : "I think she should try blurting out her feelings without thinkin', for once!",
        "60473" : "...Oh, just thought Snow White's been holdin' back too much and not sayin' what she feels.",
        "60472" : "Phew... Glad that's over with.\nNow, what was it you were saying earlier, Boss Ridinghood?",
        "60471" : "My magic is starting to grow weak...! If only I hadn't lost her...",
        "60470" : "Aww, poor baby! Are you feeling tired?",
        "59490" : "I have no excuse for my actions... Going forward, I'll double my efforts to pull myself together and get back on the ball!",
        "59496" : "I'll just have to pull out all the stops and take us through this battle!",
        "59495" : "Ugh, this doesn't look good... And right when we finally managed to catch up with Zenimaru, too!",
        "59498" : "Y-yes! I'm fine!",
        "59497" : "Take that!\nYou okay over there, Kunitsuna?",
        "59492" : "Calm down, you two. We don't have time for this. Look who showed up while you were busy arguing...!",
        "59491" : "You'll try to pull yourself together...? That doesn't exactly sound very reassuring!",
        "59494" : "Yikes, it's evil brutes! Get ready for battle, everyone!",
        "59493" : "Grrr...",
        "60009" : "We can't let her get away again, Master!",
        "60008" : "You just pop up at the most annoying times don't you? Typical!",
        "60007" : "Oh crap, it's those spirit agents again!",
        "60006" : "Wha...? Don't tell me you did this?!",
        "60489" : "Not bad for an outsider. Let's move.",
        "60005" : "Teehee...! This is delicious, absolutely delicious!",
        "60488" : "...Found it! There's a trail going off in that direction!",
        "60004" : "Oh geez, now all the kids are crying! Something weird's going on here, Master...",
        "59499" : "I'm surrounded by some very able-bodied women, aren't I? Hahaha!",
        "60487" : "Alright, I'm gonna try to sense magic that's identical to Cinderella's.",
        "60003" : "Wah... WAHHHH! Snow White DIED!",
        "60486" : "Then I can find her! Following trails of supernatural energy is my specialty!",
        "60002" : "WHAT?! I don't remember Snow White having such a horrific ending!",
        "60485" : "Well... She's the spirit of a magical object created for me by my fairy godmother...so her magic is identical to mine.",
        "60001" : "\"...And so her life came to a cruel and brutal end.\"",
        "60484" : "Leave that to me, hehehe! Cinderella, is there any way I could recognize Glassie Slipper's spirit essence?",
        "60000" : "Wait...what? Is this how the story went?",
        "60483" : "But the venue is so large...",
        "60482" : "Well, if she's here somewhere, let's get to searching!",
        "60481" : "Yes... She came with me today, but then we lost track of each other some time ago...",
        "60480" : "Glassie Slipper...? Is that another spirit from your story?",
        "60019" : "My story was used to scare children?! Oh, dear! Who would do such a thing?!",
        "60018" : "And then they all burst into tears! It was a complete mess!",
        "60017" : "A spirit changed your fairy tale into a horror story! And the reading machine read it all out loud to the children!",
        "60016" : "You look frazzled, {Username}. What's wrong?",
        "60499" : "That's a real relief. Now...sorry to rush our reunion, but I need your help.",
        "60015" : "Our best bet is to find Snow White and team up again! Come on, Master!",
        "60498" : "...Yeah. I'm fine now.",
        "60014" : "And who knows how to remove the spell she cast on the reading machine...",
        "60497" : "It's alright, don't worry... Are you feeling better now?",
        "60013" : "Wait!\n...Now where did she go? She sure knows how to run away.",
        "60496" : "Phew... That was so scary...",
        "60012" : "Ulp, I'd better run for now! Ta-ta!",
        "60495" : "All the fighting is over now, Glassie! It's gonna be okay!",
        "60011" : "A spell...? So that's how you made the story so scary! Turn it back the way it was, right this instant!",
        "60494" : "B-but...I'm NOT alright! You're probably just gonna leave me behind again...",
        "60010" : "Damnit! If I'm not careful the spell I cast on the reading machine will be removed...!",
        "60493" : "I'm so glad you're alright, Glassie.",
        "60492" : "Don't worry, Glassie! I'm here to save you!",
        "60491" : "Miss Cinderella... I think I'm about to crack...!",
        "60490" : "Yes! Cry you little babies, cry! More, MORE!",
        "60029" : "But we can't let her win! We've got to get my story back to normal and put the children's hearts at ease!",
        "60028" : "Come to think of it, she DOES seem stronger than the last time we fought. Must be all the children's fear...",
        "60027" : "But I get so much nourishment when they get all creeped out! And you're not gonna stop me!",
        "60026" : "You mean you're twisting folktales and scaring children for your own personal gain?! That is sick!",
        "60025" : "Let's just say that's how rutabagas get the nutrients they need to grow!",
        "60024" : "Teehee! You see, all the little kiddies' fear goes straight into big, bad me, and then...",
        "60023" : "But why would you do something so dreadful?",
        "60022" : "I sure did! And it's all thanks to my magic spell!",
        "60021" : "Hey, you're that spirit from before! You turned Snow White's happy ending into a nightmare!",
        "60020" : "Yes, that's it! Perfect, teehee!",
        "60039" : "[Wizard of Oz Station]",
        "60038" : "Master! Let's check on the other folktales!",
        "60037" : "So... She'll probably pull similar shenanigans with the other folktales.",
        "60036" : "Well, she said she gets nourishment from children's fear, right?",
        "60035" : "But we have no idea where she went. It won't help to wander around aimlessly...",
        "60034" : "Ulp, there she goes...\nOkay, now I'm starting to get angry! We can't let her get away again!",
        "60033" : "You idiots! If you don't like my version of the story then try and defeat all my clones! Hahaha! GOOD LUCK!",
        "60032" : "What?! There are a more of you?! How on Earth did you clone yourself...?",
        "60031" : "Teehee! With all my clones running around, you think you accomplished something just by stopping me?",
        "60030" : "Gotcha! Now, set that reading machine back to normal right this inst—",
        "60049" : "Auntie Em, give me strength. I'd rather have my house whisked off in a tornado than have to deal with this!",
        "60048" : "I don't care how much work it took! You'd better find a way to undo it, and fast!",
        "60047" : "Hey, it took a lot of work to cast that spell! I'm not gonna undo it just because you say so!",
        "60046" : "Unbelievable... You scuttle out of more tight spots than a cockroach!",
        "60045" : "Crap! It's those pesky spirit agents again... What are you doing here?!",
        "60044" : "She's at it again! I knew it! Let's help that spirit who's confronting her!",
        "60043" : "Folktales are an important part of children's lives! You can't just change them!",
        "60042" : "So give it up, there's no way I'm changing the reading machines back to normal!",
        "60041" : "Oh, I'm far from a saint... I'm more a demon.",
        "60040" : "Messing with folktales... Honestly, who even does that? You'd try the patience of a saint...",
        "60059" : "Don't worry! I'll put my scarecrows on doormat duty to keep the place safe while I go off with you!",
        "60058" : "We understand how you feel...but if no one's here to protect the Wizard of Oz Station, the same thing might happen all over again...",
        "60057" : "I can't stand how she's changed my story! Ooh, I'd just love to throw a bucket of water on her and watch her melt!",
        "60056" : "I'm Dorothy, pleased to meet you. You're trying to stop all the clones running around, right?",
        "60055" : "Cuss out God...? This spirit has an...interesting...way of expressing herself, Master.",
        "60054" : "Thanks, folks, you got me out of a real pinch! I was getting so mad I was about to cuss out God Himself!",
        "60053" : "Yes, if we defeat the clone who cast the magic, the spell seems to be lifted from the reading machine.",
        "60052" : "So the reading machine's fixed now that we beat the Rutabaga clone, right?",
        "60051" : "Oof...",
        "60050" : "Whoa, what's even going on here? Though, if she's talking about houses and tornadoes, then she must be...",
        "60069" : "Defeating the original Rutabaga is probably the best way to ensure no more trouble happens. So let's get searching!",
        "60068" : "There must be all sorts of folktale-related spirits gathered here today, and I'm sure they'll all want to know.",
        "60067" : "Right... Having someone mess with your story is enough to make any spirit wanna break bad.",
        "60066" : "Well... We also need to do to inform the other spirits about what's going on.",
        "60065" : "So we just have to run from machine to machine fighting Rutabagas? Sounds about as fun as doing farm chores back in Kansas!",
        "60064" : "Well, my reading machine's back to normal, that's for sure.",
        "60063" : "The good news is that if we defeat the clone that cast the spell, the machine goes back to normal. But that's all we know so far.",
        "60062" : "Yeah, that's why she cloned herself and cast spells to turn the reading machines' folktales into horror stories.",
        "60061" : "Huh... So the wicked witch Rutabaga feeds on children's fear?",
        "60060" : "Um, okay... I guess we could use your help!",
        "59881" : "Mikazuki Munechika! Just WHAT were you planning to do!?",
        "59880" : "Yipes! His fly is open!",
        "59883" : "\"I have captured the trust of Mikazuki Munechika.\n-Lupin the Thief\"",
        "59882" : "N-nothing! I promise, I didn't even...\n...Huh? What's this? A note?",
        "59889" : "[Bureau of the Occult]",
        "59405" : "Everyone! Let's get serious and track down Zenimaru! Okay?",
        "59888" : "...",
        "59404" : "Master... I know we're supposed to worry about Lupin's plan, but I'm a little more concerned about a certain team member right now...",
        "59407" : "And why's that? I daresay you could use my help here.",
        "59406" : "Wait. Before we do that... Mitsuyo should go back to her exhibition room.",
        "59885" : "...Well, whatever. And really, he wasn't half bad when it came to—",
        "59401" : "You guys worry too much! Personally, I think it's exciting to have a sexy spy with us!",
        "59884" : "That little...! So now the imposter AND the real Lupin's promises have come true!",
        "59400" : "I can't trust that deceptive smile of hers... I just hope she's being serious.",
        "59887" : "Ulp...!",
        "59403" : "You can certainly try. But you might not end up having your way after all.",
        "59886" : "Quit talking and zip up your pants already! You're so uncouth!",
        "59402" : "Hee hee... You such an amazing man, Mikazuki... Maybe you should let me have my way with you after all...?",
        "59409" : "Well, we do need some people to stand watch... Alright. I'll stay in the exhibition room.",
        "59408" : "The more of us there are, the harder it is for me to keep you safe. I don't know what I'd do if you were to get hurt...",
        "59892" : "But I guess things worked out pretty well, since Doppella and Mikazuki got together and everything.",
        "59891" : "I thought it was all gonna fall apart for a minute there...",
        "59894" : "The Five Great Blades are coming to Tokyo!",
        "59410" : "B-but Mitsuyo... I want to be with you a little longer...",
        "59893" : "We should check in with them next time we have a day off, Master! It'll be fun to see how things are going!",
        "59890" : "All that double-crossing thief stuff sure was wild.. But I'm glad the Five Great Blades Exhibition went off without a hitch.",
        "60405" : "That's a great idea! Then we could make all the children happy at the same time!",
        "59416" : "Tired? Then how about having a seat in my extremely comfortable chair?",
        "60404" : "We launch a bunch of fireworks, all the kids'll look up at the sky instead of starin' at the ground in tears.",
        "59899" : "But then a most unexpected message was discovered...",
        "59415" : "There's no end to them...and I can't keep this up much longer...",
        "60403" : "Calm down, I'm just talkin' about fireworks.",
        "59418" : "Ha ha ha, I'm sure it will probably be fine!",
        "60402" : "Eek! Don't start with that again! We don't want you blowing yourself up!",
        "59417" : "...Isn't that the chair with a death curse if you sit in it?",
        "60401" : "That's it. Fire off a couple big booms, and—",
        "59896" : "And the day of the Five Great Blades Exhibition drew closer and closer...",
        "59412" : "[Busby's Chair Exhibition Room]",
        "60400" : "Thing is, I'm on my own today. Even if I shoot a message to the pack...",
        "59895" : "The announcement of a new show at the museum garnered much attention.",
        "59411" : "Yeah, yeah, me, too.\nLater, Mikazuki.",
        "59898" : "The Bureau of the Occult offered its support and promised to handle any emergency situations that might arise.",
        "59414" : "...Too late for that. Look over there, someone's surrounded by them!",
        "59897" : "But as people came together, so too did evil energy.",
        "59413" : "I sense evil brutes... I sure hope nothing bad happens.",
        "59419" : "Um...thanks, but no thanks.",
        "59421" : "Is that you, Mikazuki? I'm fine... And I didn't let them lay a finger on any of the artwork.",
        "59420" : "Tsunetsugu! Are you alright?",
        "60409" : "Come, everyone, step into my carriage. I shall use my magic to propel us there in a jiffy.",
        "60408" : "The station for Sükh and the White Horse isn't far from here. Might be a good place to start...",
        "60407" : "Then let's look for spirits who can help us set off the fireworks!",
        "60406" : "I can get the product, but we'll need help to get 'em up in the air.",
        "60416" : "Ah, pleased to meet you. And not to be brusque, but we've an urgent matter. You see—",
        "59427" : "Thank you, Master. You saved the day.",

        "59429" : "Wow, thank you! I've been wanting to sit down all da—",
        "60413" : "Well, if you managed to get this close to me you must be the good kind of spirits.",
        "59428" : "As a reward, I'll let you sit in my chair! How about it?",
        "60412" : "...Do you hear that music? It's so beautiful... I've become lost in the melody without even realizing it...",
        "59423" : "But you can relax now that we're here.",
        "60411" : "It looks like she hasn't cast any spells here yet. What a relief...!",

        "59424" : "Good. I was really getting tired of dealing with so many brutes...",
        "59430" : "Rumor has it that chair is cursed, you know.",
        "59432" : "Anyway, I'm glad everyone's safe. Have you been protecting this exhibition the whole time, Tsunetsugu?",
        "59431" : "C-cursed?!\nUm, m-maybe I'll just stand after all...",
        "60419" : "I must've let my attention slip... Perhaps I could get your help with these uninvited guests?",
        "60418" : "Teehee...! I finally made it past your annoying musical barrier!",
        "60417" : "Wait...! I hear a foul cacophony approaching...",

        "60426" : "B-but... Even so, think about the bigger picture here!",
        "59437" : "That's odd, I could swear they went this way. I guess a famous thief like him doesn't just leave a trail of breadcrumbs behind him...",
        "60425" : "I can't let Rutabaga invade my station and befoul my sweet memories of Sükh.",
        "60424" : "Hmm... I'm sorry, but no. I can't go with you.",
        "59439" : "Hee hee... I might have a clue for you...",
        "60423" : "Morin...we could use a hand dealing with all the Rutabaga clones. Would you mind helping us out?",

        "60422" : "We did it! And now that that's settled...",

        "60420" : "Your music is incredible, Morin! I can barely believe how beautiful it is!",
        "59435" : "Yeah. But then she went running off after this Lupin guy...",
        "59441" : "Hee hee... Well, I can sense some of Lupin's evil brutes being cleansed...",
        "59440" : "You do?! Then please tell us!",
        "59443" : "A klutz who cleanses evil... Are you talking about Kunitsuna?",
        "59442" : "And wasn't one of the Five Great Blades a klutz who had a knack for taking care of evil?",
        "60429" : "...Thanks for understanding. I don't know how much it helps you, but I can promise I'll at least keep my area safe.",
        "60428" : "I know exactly how Morin Khuur feels about wanting to protect her story. Every spirit here feels the same.",
        "60438" : "Um...hello?",
        "59449" : "Oh, I couldn't do that. I'm too excited to see what happens next!",
        "60437" : "Oh, we know it does! That's why you're not only crazy, but also amazing! You're CRAYMAZING!",
        "59448" : "This is getting old, Lupin! Give up already!",
        "60436" : "H-hey... It hurts me a lot to know my story has been twisted by Rutabaga's magic, too!",
        "60435" : "Um...",
        "60434" : "She is an odd duck when it comes to folktale spirits, that's for sure.",
        "59445" : "Then let's head to Kunitsuna's exhibition room, on the double!",
        "60433" : "What do you expect? Running off and leaving her story unprotected like Snow White is pretty crazy.",
        "59444" : "A good guess. Perhaps she's somehow found a way to stop Lupin...?",
        "60432" : "This recruiting allies thing isn't going so well...",
        "59447" : "Impressive... And just what I'd expect from one of the Five Great Blades.",
        "60431" : "...Splendid. Then I'll pray for your safety as I play my next tune.",
        "59446" : "[Near Onimaru Kunitsuna's Exhibition Room]",
        "60430" : "We appreciate it. I'm positive that your efforts will aid us in our journey.",
        "59452" : "Hey, Kunitsuna, the cavalry's here. Everything's gonna be okay.",
        "59451" : "Even more of them...? Ugh...this isn't good...",
        "59454" : "Ah! I tripped...!",
        "59453" : "...Huh? Mikazuki?! Th-thank you so much!",
        "59450" : "Grrr...",
        "60439" : "I agree... To meet THE Snow White in the flesh and witness her altruism for the children...I'm truly moved!",
        "60449" : "Um, well... You're looking for help, right?",
        "60448" : "Phew, we're finally through!\nSo, Bluebird, you said you had something you wanted to talk about...?",
        "59459" : "Though I must say it puts me in a tough spot to face three of the Five Great Blades at once...",
        "60447" : "Um... I've been here the whole time. You just didn't notice...",
        "60446" : "...Eh, Bluebird got behind me? When did she manage that?!",
        "60445" : "You're the one with the sinister plan!\n...Sorry, Bluebird, but can we save the talking for after we deal with her?",
        "59456" : "Th-that's all the evil brutes...!",
        "60444" : "Teehee! What kind of sinister plans are you guys cooking up over here?",
        "59455" : "...Careful now. There's nothing to worry about now that we're here.",
        "60443" : "My name's Bluebird. And there's actually something I wanted to talk to you about...",
        "59458" : "Me? You just don't know how this works, do you?",
        "60442" : "It's been a while, now... I guess I'm just not very noticeable...",
        "59457" : "Looks like the tables have turned, Lupin. Time for YOU to be the one tied up.",
        "60441" : "Ahh! How long have you been standing there?!",
        "60440" : "Ex...EXCUSE ME!",
        "59463" : "Heh... Don't you know that every circle has a hole? You know...like this one!",
        "59462" : "Yeah, what she said! We've got you surrounded! You'll never get away this time!",
        "59465" : "Thank you for that very thrilling experience. Until next time!",
        "59464" : "Ahh! You c-can't just attack me like that...! He slipped right under my arm!",
        "59461" : "Don't get cocky, Lupin. Do you realize what you're up against here...?",
        "59460" : "Oh well, so be it. We're only just getting started, after all...",
        "60459" : "The only others I can think to ask for help are Don Quixote and Aks Goldsilver.",
        "60458" : "Well, according to the festival map, we've now met all the spirits whose folktales are part of the festival.",
        "60457" : "Sorry... That's all I can think to say right now. So...good bye.",
        "60456" : "It's okay, Cinderella, calm down!\nAlright, Bluebird, We'll leave you in peace to protect your story.",
        "59467" : "Grrr...",
        "60455" : "Abandoned?! I'll have you know that Snow White has the most noble reasons for her actions!",
        "59466" : "Master, we have to go aft—",
        "60454" : "Sorry. But I was also wondering...why did Snow White abandon her story to help you?",
        "59469" : "We've gotta finish off these evil brutes fast so we can go after him...!",
        "60453" : "Oh... So you can't help us either...",
        "59468" : "So he's just gonna run off and leave us with his evil brutes? That little...",
        "60452" : "Not many people know about me or my story...but it's still important to me! I have to make sure it doesn't get turned into something terrible...",
        "60451" : "Then I have to apologize. The reason I wanted to talk was actually to tell you I can't help.",
        "60450" : "Yes, we're trying to change the children's tears to smiles. If you could lend us a hand...",
        "59474" : "We got rid of the evil brutes, but there's not a trace of Lupin in sight...",
        "59473" : "Are you kidding? He attacked Kunitsuna! He doesn't deserve your praise!",
        "59476" : "Don't feel bad. I'm just glad no harm fell upon those beautiful hands of yours...",
        "59475" : "Sorry, guys... If I hadn't been such an easy target...",
        "59470" : "That was dirty of him to go after you, Kunitsuna... Can you stand?",
        "59472" : "To face a spirit agent and three of the Five Great Blades and STILL manage to escape? Villain or no, I've got to give him his props.",
        "59471" : "Y-yes, I'm fine...! I can still fight!",
        "60469" : "Unfortunately... We'll just have to fight her off, as always...",
        "60468" : "Cripes, she butts into conversations like it's her job...",
        "60467" : "Teehee...! You're still here? What, were you just waiting for me to attack you again?",
        "59478" : "...Cut it out, Mikazuki. You shouldn't bother her so much.",
        "60466" : "It's nothin' complicated, just—",
        "59477" : "?!\nIs there a reason you're holding my hands now?",
        "60465" : "Huh? What do you mean?",
        "60464" : "If that's the case, maybe it's time we got down to brass tacks.",
        "59479" : "Ouch! There's no need for the tough love!\n...Hey, over there. Is that...?",
        "60463" : "Oh, Snow White...",
        "60462" : "But I can still hear the sound of those children crying... I just want to comfort them as quickly as we can...",
        "60461" : "Yeah, they're like me—they prefer to focus on their own turf when it's under attack.",
        "60460" : "But I have no idea where they are, and I dunno how much help they'd be with the fireworks anyway.",
        "59603" : "Aren't you the ladies man? But maybe it's time you start to think about settling down...?",
        "59602" : "Oh, really...? But the more obstacles in the way, the more exciting the chase!",
        "59605" : "We're too busy for that now... Isn't that right, Lupin?",
        "59604" : "So you're here after all, Shosoin. You can save the lectures about my love life.",
        "59601" : "Control yourself, Mikazuki! Tuna's already spoken for!",
        "59600" : "...That guy's with you, too?",
        "59607" : "Um... I think it's been twice so far!",
        "59606" : "So nice to see you again, haha! How many times have we run into each other now?",
        "59609" : "What? Are you sure?",
        "59608" : "No, Sola, I'm pretty sure it's been three times...",
        "60603" : "Master and I will handle getting permission from the Bureau of the Occult to launch fireworks.",
        "59614" : "Let's hurry up and end this game of cat-and-mouse once and for all!",
        "60602" : "In other words, you want us to be your packhorses, that it? ...'Cause that's exactly my kinda job!",
        "59613" : "You use the same trick every time, Lupin, and it's starting to get old...",
        "60601" : "And I was hoping you all could help me put the fireworks in place.",
        "59616" : "Hmph! I don't care who you are or where you're from, but you are NOT going to catch me.",
        "60600" : "You're going to launch fireworks to get the children's attention and make them happy...?",
        "59615" : "I'll get you this time, Lupin!",
        "59610" : "Look, it doesn't matter how many times it's been...'cause this one's gonna be the last.",
        "59612" : "Grrr...",
        "59611" : "Is it, now...? So you really think you can catch me?",
        "59618" : "Ergh! We were so close, too!",
        "59617" : "He slipped away in the confusion of battle...as usual!",
        "59619" : "...But according to the map, there's a dead end in the direction he went.",
        "60609" : "Taking on the risk is the least I can do!",
        "60608" : "I know it's dangerous, but after everyone was so kind to respond to my call...",
        "60607" : "A diversion, eh? Classic! ...And dangerous. Are you sure you can handle it?",
        "60606" : "Don't worry, I'll keep Rutabaga and her clones distracted until all the preparations are complete.",
        "60605" : "There's just one catch... You-know-who isn't gonna just wait and let you drop a house on her.",
        "60604" : "We'd like to make a special announcement to get the kids excited, too!",
        "60614" : "Sure thing, Cinderella! I appreciate it!",
        "59625" : "We've got you cornered, Lupin! You may as well give up!",
        "60613" : "Er, Snow White... Please allow me to assist you with the diversion!",
        "59624" : "Maybe that's what you think...",
        "60612" : "This should be no problem for us. We've got this!",
        "59627" : "I don't care about beautiful women. I'm...",
        "60611" : "And here's one last problem that needs to be eliminated...",
        "59626" : "You've been cornered by beautiful women, Lupin... What more could a man ask for?",
        "60610" : "Hot damn! I found ya!",
        "59621" : "Whoa... What's gotten into Zenimaru all of a sudden?",
        "59620" : "Wait, really...? Then this is IT! He's finally run out of luck! LUPINNN!",
        "59623" : "LUPIN! At long last, you're mine!",
        "59622" : "Ergh... It's a dead end.",
        "59629" : "I, er... I meant to say...this isn't over yet!",
        "59628" : "Hm? You're...what?",
        "59630" : "Lupin! Quick, over here!",
        "60619" : "And we'll do what we can to help you while we contact the Bureau of the Occult!",
        "60618" : "Don't worry!",
        "60617" : "We're countin' on you for the distractions, alright?",
        "60616" : "Yep. Guess we'll be goin' our separate ways for a bit then.",
        "60615" : "We fended off the clones...! Now it's time to put our plan into action!",
        "60625" : "...I'll be fine. Let's get started. Bibbity, bobbity...boo!",
        "59636" : "You'll never escape me, Lupin! I'm gonna catch you if it's the last thing I ever do! LUPINNN!",
        "60624" : "But Miss Cinderella...you shouldn't keep using your powers so much...",
        "59635" : "But he can't go far this time. Let's hurry up and chase him down!",
        "60623" : "I'm on it! Can you lend me a hand, Glassie?",
        "59638" : "That's that! Now, about that demon woman he called \"Naphula\"...",
        "60622" : "Make sure the announcement only reaches spirits, okay, Cinderella?",
        "59637" : "Alright already, Zenimaru... Can you calm down a little?",
        "60621" : "First of all, the diversion! Let's use this mic and see if we can give Rutabaga a good run for her money!",
        "59632" : "He's got backup?! ...Hold it right there, Lupin!",
        "60620" : "...Alright, Master! Time to beat that Rutabaga to mash!",
        "59631" : "Thanks, Naphula!",
        "59634" : "There he goes again... Darnit!",
        "59633" : "Grr....",
        "59639" : "I was thinking the same thing. Who is she?",
        "60191" : "Poisona Appel! What are you doing here?",
        "60190" : "...I'm nothing of the sort!\nBut...I've finally found you, Snow White!",
        "60199" : "Poisona is kinda starting to creep me out...",
        "60198" : "Hmm... Maybe it's time for a nice, long sleep? Yesss, sleeeeep...",
        "60197" : "I've got a lot of questions for you...but first we need to find a way out of here.",
        "60196" : "She's right. We made amends long ago, and there's no longer any bad blood between us.",
        "60195" : "Assassination was my job back then! I had no say in the matter...hehe.",
        "60194" : "...I know what you're thinking, but relax. I have no intention of hurting anyone.",
        "60193" : "Don't tell me you're trying to kill Snow White again! Wasn't once enough?!",
        "60192" : "Poisona...Appel? As in the poisoned apple Snow White took a bite of in her story?",
        "60109" : "You are no ore than the lowly servant of some evil witch—I can tell just from one look. And now it is time for you to die!",
        "60119" : "Yeah! Let's make a beeline for Bluebird Station and—",
        "60118" : "At least we alerted him about the danger to his story. Now I think it's time we get a move on ourselves!",
        "60117" : "Wow, he really has a lot of energy! But do you think he's gonna be okay...?",
        "60116" : "Leave the defense of the castle to me! Now then, as much as it pains me to bid you farewell... Onward, Rocinante!",
        "60599" : "We've got a plan, so let's get started on it!",
        "60115" : "Ha ha, no need to continue! As a knight, I am bound by oath to do anything a princess asks!",
        "60598" : "But with all of you here I know we'll be okay...!",
        "60114" : "The spirit you just saw has been causing trouble, and I'm afraid that your station may also—",
        "60597" : "We defeat them all, but then even more come...and the children still cry! I don't like this enemy!",
        "60113" : "Don Quixote, I'd like to ask for your help with something...",
        "60596" : "But there'll keep being more clones until we find and defeat the real Rutabaga.",
        "60112" : "Ah... Y-yes, yes! Of course, I am a knight, simply doing what knights do! Ha ha ha!",
        "60595" : "They must've gotten pretty scared... We need to show them everything will be alright...",
        "60111" : "Thanks, Don Quixote, you really helped us out! You're a real knight in shining armor!",
        "60594" : "We got rid of all those nasty turnips, but the kids are still crying as hard as ever...",
        "60110" : "He's awfully strong, but he seems to get a little carried away...",
        "60593" : "I know! I'm feeling really touched by everyone's effort...!",
        "60592" : "Heh... I guess even outsider allies ain't so bad sometimes.",
        "60591" : "Holy cow, there's so many of them... But they'll still never beat us!",
        "60590" : "Enough! I've had enough of this! It's time for us clones to come together and get serious!",
        "60129" : "Wh-what's happening? She seemed perfectly normal five seconds ago!",
        "60128" : "There you are...my enemy! I'm gonna chop you in HALF! ENEMYYYYYY!",
        "60127" : "Ah! I spy with my little eye...a spirit agent!",
        "60126" : "You were? Then we're after the same spirit!",
        "60125" : "Me? The name's Aks Goldsilver. I was just trying to track down the spirit that messed with my reading machine.",
        "60124" : "N-no problem... So, um, who are you anyway?",
        "60123" : "...I do? Whoops, sorry about that.",
        "60122" : "Wha...? No, you've got it all wrong!",
        "60121" : "Don't tell me your on their side, too!",
        "60120" : "*huff...puff...*\n...Huh? What are YOU staring at?",
        "60139" : "Hey, wait!\n...And she's gone.",
        "60138" : "I'll chop down every last one of them! I haven't had enough chopping yet! LEMME AT 'EM!!!",
        "60137" : "...Wait. I sense something approaching from behind. It's...the ENEMYYYY!",
        "60136" : "Anyway, there's something we need to tell—",
        "60135" : "I've heard the name, but you're not exactly what I was expecting...",
        "60134" : "Yep. Didn't I tell you?",
        "60133" : "Um, Aks... Are you based on one of Aesop's Fables...\"The Honest Woodcutter\"?",
        "60132" : "Phew, there we go.... The coast is clear!",
        "60131" : "Aks is great in battle but she's a little on the, um...extreme side.",
        "60130" : "What's it gonna be...your life or mine? 'Cause one of them is gonna end today!",
        "60149" : "Supernatural energy like that makes it rather obvious. Who wouldn't notice?",
        "60148" : "Oh, aren't you a clever little girl! Full points!",
        "60147" : "Does that mean you're...the REAL Rutabaga?",
        "60146" : "Wait, I'm sensing really powerful supernatural energy... It's unlike anything we've seen from the clones so far.",
        "60145" : "You're nobody's favorite! And we don't have time for your games!",
        "60144" : "Tadaaa! It's your FAVORITE baddie, Miss Rutabaga!",
        "60143" : "Not so fast, wise guys! Teehee!",
        "60142" : "Anyway, let's head to Bluebird ar—",
        "60141" : "...I hear you. It's like she goes into berserker mode, or something...",
        "60140" : "I have a feeling we're better off with her running around on her own, actually...",
        "60159" : "I guess I have no choice but to hear you out since I lost...",
        "60158" : "...Enough. It's time for you to remove your spells from the folktale reading machines.",
        "60157" : "She's just messing with us...! This fight's at a completely different level than our first encounter...",
        "60156" : "Hey! Over here, guys!",
        "60155" : "You will not! We'll capture you like the villain you are and put a stop to all of this!",
        "60154" : "It's all the same in the end! I'll crush you with my incredible new strength!",
        "60153" : "Teehee! Say whatever you want!",
        "60152" : "Just think of all the stories you ruined and children you freaked out! You're not gonna get away with this!",
        "60151" : "Teehee! All that delicious fear really boosted my powers!",
        "60150" : "Okay, fair. And after all that wonderful nourishment, I'm just dying to show you how strong I really am!",
        "60169" : "Teeheehe! Thanks for falling for such an obvious trick! So kind of you!",
        "60168" : "Wiggling Winkies! She just slammed the door in our faces!",
        "60167" : "...There's no one in here. Are you sure this is the right room?",
        "60166" : "That poor spirit is right through these doors...",
        "60165" : "Really sorry about that... Here, follow me!",
        "60164" : "That spirit must be in grave danger! Show us the way, immediately!",
        "60163" : "And then, to keep her company, I stuffed in a bunch of my clones, too...",
        "60162" : "See, I found a spirit wandering around so I locked her up in a room over there.",
        "60161" : "What's that supposed to mean...?",
        "60160" : "But there's one thing you might wanna check out before we get too deep in our conversation...",
        "60179" : "Nng! There's always more of them no matter how many we defeat!",
        "60178" : "That's not true!\n...Though, actually it kinda is...",
        "60177" : "*sigh*...\nI suppose I'm just as gullible in real life as I am in my story...",
        "60176" : "Sitting here complaining won't help... So let's get to fighting!",
        "60175" : "Ruh-roh! Now we're really in a pickle!",
        "60174" : "We're completely surrounded by clones...",
        "60173" : "It's your fault for falling for it! So calm down and accept that you're a bunch of idiots!",
        "60172" : "Yeah, you big bully! Don't you know that lying is the first step to a life of crime?",
        "60171" : "That's more like a NO thank you! Ooh, we should've known you'd never do anything genuinely helpful!",
        "60170" : "As a thank you for your kindness, I offer you an extra-special batch of my clones!",
        "60180" : "This isn't like anything we've done before, {Username}... There are just too many of them...",
        "60189" : "AAHHHH! Who's laughing in the shadows over there? A ghost?!",
        "60188" : "Hehe...hehehe...!",
        "60187" : "Yeah, save your energy for Rutabaga! She's the one who's responsible for this! Deep breaths, deep breaths...",
        "60186" : "S-stay calm! Getting emotional will only waste energy!",
        "60185" : "Crikey, mate! This place is absolutely SWARMING with clones!",
        "60184" : "Alright... It's time to double down, Master!",
        "60183" : "Our only choice is to keep taking them down one by one... Hang in there, everyone!",
        "60182" : "If the clones weren't in the way, we might be able to find an exit...",
        "60181" : "Ooh! I'm ready to click my heels together and get out of here!",
        "59520" : "...I appreciate your support, Mikazuki. But they're right...I failed in my duties.",
        "60509" : "Okay! S-so...",
        "60508" : "We're right here with you, Snow White! Do your best!",
        "60507" : "Sure do. Just be honest with your feelings, and yell 'em out.",
        "60506" : "I guess I really have to do this, don't I...",
        "60505" : "Testing, one-two...\nSounds like it's working. You're up, Snow White! Give us a speech that'll make even a humbug act like a wizard!",
        "60515" : "That's why I came to this festival in the first place...because I wanted to see the children enjoy the stories with my own eyes.",
        "59526" : "No...I think this is exactly the fish that needs frying. I wanna make some things crystal clear.",
        "60514" : "I know how important each of your folktales is to you... But I think the children who listen to our stories are just as important.",
        "59525" : "This is NOT the time for in-fighting! We've got bigger fish to fry!",
        "60513" : "I know everyone has a lot on their plate already, but please hear me out...",
        "59528" : "It's useless to try to talk sense to him now. You'd be better off getting ready to fight.",
        "60512" : "She looks so nervous... Hang in there, Snow White! You can do it!",
        "59527" : "Luzon, calm down! You don't have to do this!",
        "60511" : "I have something I'd like to ask of you... I mean, I guess I've already m-mentioned it to some of you...",
        "59522" : "M-Mikazuki...!",
        "60510" : "...Umm. Can you hear me, everyone? This is Snow White speaking.",
        "59521" : "You shouldn't be demoted over one measly mistake... But it's okay, I'll come along to give you a helping hand!",
        "59524" : "What? Think you can force me to do what you want?",
        "59523" : "He just doesn't listen, does he? I see how it is...!",
        "59529" : "...It's over, Luzon. You're finished.",
        "59531" : "Luzon is really strong... But you were barely even trying, Mikazuki.",
        "59530" : "Ghk... I had no idea you were this strong!",
        "60519" : "Listen to all that applause, Master! It was such an amazing speech!",
        "60518" : "So I'm begging you... Please help me bring smiles back to all the children's faces!",
        "60517" : "And it makes me so sad to see the children who came to enjoy our stories end up crying instead!",
        "60516" : "Oh, Snow White...! You're doing great!",
        "60526" : "*pant, pant...*\nNo need to be a worrywart. I simply used a little more magic than normal, that's all.",
        "59537" : "Look, a man like me can get very hot and hard when it comes to—",
        "60525" : "Miss Cinderella... Are you okay?!",
        "59536" : "...Are you stubborn, or just stupid? Sheesh!",
        "60524" : "UGH! You're not the one we wanted to attract!",
        "59539" : "...What? I just meant that my passion can get heated and my resolve is very firm. Is there a problem with that?",
        "60523" : "Oh gosh, your speech was SO moving! I came running as soon as I heard it!",
        "59538" : "H-hold it right there, Mikazuki! What exactly are you trying to say?!",
        "60522" : "Heh... I thought you put on a pretty impressive show. Now...we just wait and see.",
        "59533" : "Ha ha, I can't reveal all my tricks. Mysterious secrets are what make a man a man!",
        "60521" : "You d-didn't have to point it out...!",
        "59532" : "I wonder what you fight like when you actually make an effort...",
        "60520" : "It sure was! But check out Snow White's face. It's redder than a pair of ruby slippers!",
        "59535" : "B-but... What if there's an emergency, or...or something really bad happens?!",
        "59534" : "Anyway, I'll rest my case here. I think this proves that I don't need your protection.",
        "59540" : "Ah, n-no, sorry... Please continue...",
        "59542" : "We've got me, {Username}, Zenimaru, and you, too. All together in one spot.",
        "59541" : "So as I was saying, I know you're strong, Luzon... But think about it.",
        "60529" : "I wonder if anyone else will actually show up...",
        "60528" : "That meddler... All she does is get in our way.",
        "60527" : "Phew... Is that the end for now?",
        "60537" : "Sure you can! That's exactly what I'm aiming for!",
        "59548" : "N-no need to be humble now. We need to move quickly, and come up with a new plan for defense!",
        "60536" : "We can't get defeated before anyone has a chance to arrive...!",
        "59547" : "My apologies, Inspector Zenimaru. It may be a little late, but I hope we can work well together.",
        "60535" : "Um...",
        "60534" : "Not her again... It's like annoying us is her full-time job!",
        "59549" : "No, that won't be necessary. I'll put my militia on defense, and I'll take charge of the investigative team as well.",
        "60533" : "Teehee...! You're never gonna make the children smile...not if I have any say in the matter!",
        "59544" : "Ah! W-well...",
        "60532" : "...You're right. I should have more faith in the other spirits.",
        "59543" : "Do you really think that empty exhibition room is a safer place for me to be?",
        "60531" : "Yeah. All we can do now is wait.",
        "59546" : "Yeah... We should do this together, hand-in-hand...",
        "60530" : "I'm sure they will! You gave such a heartfelt speech!",
        "59545" : "Luzon... I think we got a little too worked up earlier.",
        "59551" : "Not at all! I'd like the inspector to work together with us to apprehend Lupin and keep Mikazuki safe.",
        "59550" : "So...in other words, you're stripping Zenimaru of all her duties?",
        "59553" : "Okay, it's settled! I agree to cooperate with you on this plan to the best of my abilities!",
        "59552" : "...Oh! Then yes...that might be the most effective strategy given our current situation.",
        "60539" : "Augh! Wh-when did you get here?!",
        "60538" : "I wonder if they're gonna notice... Um, can anyone see me back here? ...Y-yikes!",
        "60548" : "Heh, so you pulled it off after all. I've gotta say, you've shown yourself to be a real stand-up guy.",
        "59559" : "Shh! Don't get him started again...!",
        "60547" : "Now we've got more than enough strength on our side! Let's take care of those clones!",
        "59558" : "It never ceases to amaze me how Mikazuki always gets out of trouble at the last minute like this...",
        "60546" : "Thank both of you so much...!",
        "60545" : "Once I heard your speech, I realized that this is what Sükh would want me to do.",
        "60544" : "Morin! You decided to come, too?",
        "59555" : "So, everything hashed out, now?",
        "60543" : "What the...? I'm not the first to arrive?! I thought I was a fast runner, too!",
        "59554" : "I appreciate that you are willing to cooperate with us on this.",
        "60542" : "Well, I started to think... How can I call myself the Bluebird of Happiness in front of children who are so unhappy?",
        "59557" : "Heh... In that case, let's get a move on and find that thief already!",
        "60541" : "Bluebird...! You actually came!",
        "59556" : "Yes, thanks to you, Mikazuki.",
        "60540" : "I've been here for a while now...",
        "59562" : "Anyway, Master... Let's go catch ourselves a famous thief!",
        "59561" : "Looks like the Five Great Blades know Mikazuki better than he knows himself, hehe....",
        "59564" : "Wonderful. I'll do everything I can to fulfill my duty.",
        "59563" : "Alright, de' Medici, we're leaving the security operations to you!",
        "59560" : "Ah, right...! I'll keep my thoughts to myself then.",
        "60549" : "I am fairly certain that Snow White identifies as a stand-up \"lady\".",
        "60559" : "M-Miss Cinderella...! Look out!",
        "60558" : "Aw, Cindy, don't tell me you're pooped already! Maybe I should put you down for a long rest!",
        "59569" : "In this case, I think it's the optimal approach. Right, Mikazuki?",
        "60557" : "Oh...oh. I need to support everyone with my magic...",
        "60556" : "Ulp! Our situation's quickly going from bad to worse!",
        "60555" : "...Yeah. I can feel it, too!",
        "59566" : "Yeah! I know a thing or two about taking care of evil brutes, you know!",
        "60554" : "It's alright, you're not the only ones we're expecting! Others will show up, I just know it!",
        "59565" : "Kunitsuna and I will help de' Medici, too.",
        "60553" : "I'm not the best when it comes to combat, either... I wasn't up to the task...",
        "59568" : "But protection isn't my forte. And one must do what one does best, yes?",
        "60552" : "Sorry I couldn't be of more use...",
        "59567" : "I can't believe I'm asking the Five Great Blades to help me, when I'm supposed to be protecting them.",
        "60551" : "*pant, pant...*\nI can't believe how many we fought and we're still not done...!",
        "60550" : "Who cares? Quit gettin' hung up about gender and just take the compliment!",
        "59573" : "Perhaps we could use it to help track him down.",
        "59572" : "Well, de' Medici gave me this equipment to view security footage from all over the building.",
        "59575" : "Alright, here we go...",
        "59574" : "We have security footage...?! That changes everything! Quick, get it rolling!",
        "59571" : "Then that leaves us to deal with Lupin! So, um...where do we start?",
        "59570" : "Yes! It makes me sad to say goodbye to dear Tsunetsugu...but somehow, I'll survive...",
        "60569" : "I shall be the spear that stands against your foes! The knight in shining armor of whom you've always dreamed!",
        "60568" : "Snow White! Your speech touched me so deeply... Honest people like you deserve to be rewarded!",
        "60567" : "It's Aks Goldsilver!",
        "60566" : "AAHHH! Not that clone-killing berserker, too!",
        "59577" : "That's from where they're exhibiting treasures from Shosoin.",
        "60565" : "*huff...puff...*\nENEMY SIGHTED!!!",
        "59576" : "Look how he moves through the camera's blind spot...but you can still catch a glimpse of him here!",
        "60564" : "Can it with the grandstanding! This party's plenty big enough already, so you can just—",
        "59579" : "[Shosoin Treasures Exhibition Hall]",
        "60563" : "Don Quixote! You came!",
        "59578" : "Who knows if he's still there...but we have nothing else to go on! Let's go check it out, Master!",
        "60562" : "They call me Don Quixote, and I always respond to the call of a princess in distress!",
        "60561" : "Hey! Watch it, punk! Who're you supposed to be, anyway?",
        "60560" : "Ah———\n...Ah? I'm...uninjured?",
        "59584" : "Stay behind me, Zenimaru. I work best when I'm protecting lovely ladies like you.",
        "59583" : "Grrr...",
        "59586" : "I can personally guarantee Master's strength. Leave all the tough stuff to us!",
        "59585" : "I appreciate the sentiment, but I'd be a complete failure if I let you protect me instead of the other way around.",
        "59580" : "He walked right through here on the video...",
        "59582" : "There's no mistaking that... But I don't care how many there are, I'll beat 'em to a pulp.",
        "59581" : "I'm sensing a very large number of evil brutes up ahead.",
        "60579" : "You're doing great. I'll keep the place safe with my music so you can fight freely.",
        "60578" : "Let's put our powers together and finish the job!",
        "60577" : "Looks like we've made good progress with the clones!",
        "59588" : "Phew! We made it past where most of the evil brutes were.",
        "60576" : "*pant, pant...*\nCertainly...there was little doubt! Snow White, you are just so...amazing!",
        "59587" : "Oho... It's kinda nice, having someone to watch my back.",
        "60575" : "Heh. I figured this would happen after I heard that speech of yours!",
        "60574" : "Yeah! We've got the full team now! We're unstoppable!",
        "59589" : "But there's no sign of Lupin, and plenty of places to hide... Why IS this exhibition hall so big?",
        "60573" : "This is incredible... I can't believe everyone actually showed up!",
        "60572" : "Yikes! I'm not an enemy! Please leave me out of your rampage!",
        "60571" : "*huff, puff...!*\nDESTROY ALL ENEMIES!!!",
        "60570" : "*huff, puff...!*\nBetter stay back! I'm about to go on an axe-swinging rampage!",
        "59595" : "You persistent little...! Just who do you think you are, anyway?",
        "59594" : "Wait, I know...it's Tuna! Come on, Master, we have to check on her!",
        "59597" : "I knew that was Tuna's voice!",
        "59596" : "Hehe... You want to make this as hard for me as possible, don't you?",
        "59591" : "Anyhow, we should conduct a thorough search of the entire hall, and—",
        "59590" : "A number of items from the Shosoin treasure house are on display. This is the largest exhibition hall here, actually.",
        "59593" : "Did you hear that? I recognize that voice...",
        "59592" : "That's it! Prepare to die!",
        "60108" : "They call me Don Quixote! And I will never let you lay one finger on this princess!",
        "60107" : "Who the hell are you, and what makes you think you can just barge in like this?!",
        "60106" : "What luck! I have dedicated my life to punishing evil-doers who would dare harm a princess!",
        "60589" : "Wowzers, you guys did a great job together! Talk about teamwork!",
        "60105" : "What? Y-yes... I'm Princess Snow White.",
        "60588" : "Oof...",
        "60104" : "...Oho!\nYou would not be a princess, by chance?",
        "59599" : "Dojigiri! Aren't you looking cute as ever!",
        "60587" : "...Tsk, tsk. You left your rear completely unguarded!",
        "60103" : "Thank you for stepping in, sir. You saved us.",
        "59598" : "{Username}, Sola!",
        "60586" : "YOWCH!",
        "60102" : "...Is everything alright, ladies?",
        "60585" : "Enemyyy! I'll chop you all to pieces!",
        "60101" : "Striking first is the best way to win, you know!\n...AGH!",
        "60584" : "Facing these numbers is like taking on an army of giants! Or dinosaurs! I imagine...",
        "60100" : "Hey, that's not fair! We weren't ready for an attack!",
        "60583" : "AGH!",
        "60582" : "Heh... Don't leave me out. Though this could be dangerous, so feel free to surrender now.",
        "60581" : "You're the one who's been ganging up on US, you overgrown turnip! So get ready to be mashed into Rutabaga stew!",
        "60580" : "C-crap! They're ganging up on me!",
        "59702" : "That's not the conclusion I was hoping you'd reach...",
        "59701" : "Yes, but if you got your act together, you might actually be an okay guy.",
        "59704" : "...But it's obvious that he's earned the trust and respect of his allies.",
        "59703" : "I still can't bring myself to trust Mikazuki...",
        "59700" : "Like is a strong word. You're still pretty annoying.",
        "59709" : "My real name is Doppella Gänger. I used Naphula's powers to imitate Lupin.",
        "59706" : "...No worries. You've already helped me more than enough. Thank you.",
        "59705" : "I'm sorry, Lupin...but this is as far as I can go with you.",
        "59708" : "L-Lupin's actually a woman...?!",
        "59707" : "Listen, everyone... I'm sorry for deceiving you...",
        "60702" : "Of course... Because I have the strength of my friends to support me!",
        "59713" : "I just wanted to get closer to Mikazuki...!",
        "60701" : "Teehee...! But you're all worn out from my clones, while I'm fully rested! Do you really think you can beat me?",
        "59712" : "Well, I...",
        "60700" : "...It's time to put an end to this.",
        "59715" : "You can't be serious, Doppella!",
        "59714" : "What?! That's what this was all about...?",
        "59711" : "The way you were talking DID sound kinda strange...b-but why did you do this?",
        "59710" : "...",
        "59717" : "B-but...weren't both of you heaping on the praise just a few minutes ago?",
        "59716" : "This is madness! You'd regret choosing a man like that in a heartbeat...!",
        "59719" : "But we don't have to play all these games. You can be upfront and honest with me.",
        "59718" : "...I'm glad to hear your true feelings, Doppella.",
        "60709" : "Grr! Don't get in my way! You're so ANNOYING!",
        "60708" : "Not so fast! Just 'cause you snuck up on her doesn't mean you snuck past me!",
        "60707" : "You're the one bluffing, Snow White... YAH! Take that!",
        "60706" : "Everyone...! Lend me your strength!",
        "60705" : "Blah, blah, blah! It's time to finish you losers off!",
        "60704" : "You really have no idea, do you...",
        "60703" : "Ugh...! Don't you even start with that friendship bull!",
        "60713" : "Hehe... And me, too, of course.",
        "59724" : "So Doppella, you weren't trying to do anything bad, you just wanted to get closer to Mikazuki...right?",
        "60712" : "Don't forget about me, either!",
        "59723" : "Alright... Let me try and get everything straight.",
        "60711" : "Because Snow White's got ME on her side.",
        "59726" : "Don't worry, all of the artwork should be completely undamaged.",
        "60710" : "What is this...? How can I be losing?!",
        "59725" : "That's right. I'm so sorry for stirring up such a fuss...",
        "59720" : "O-okay...!",
        "59722" : "He's acting smooth, but I get the feeling this is actually one of the happiest moments of his life...",
        "59721" : "What can I say? The ladies love me! Hehe...",
        "59728" : "I see... So manual dexterity really does come in handy after all...",
        "59727" : "I used my powers to grant the evil brutes sufficient manual dexterity to avoid damaging anything.",
        "59729" : "I never intended for things to get so out of hand...",
        "60719" : "I was hoping to finish you off without digging into my nourishment reserves...",
        "60718" : "Idiots... How dare you... Though I can't deny that you guys are pretty dang strong.",
        "60717" : "Alright, Rutabaga! How about giving up this silly fight now?",
        "60716" : "...I'm as thrilled as you are, but don't let your guard down just yet.",
        "60715" : "Hah! Looks like you just got owned by the power of friendship!",
        "60714" : "I as well... I contributed something, too!",
        "60724" : "No way! How has she got this much spirit essence now?! One transformation is enough!",
        "59735" : "What...? W-wait a minute! Don't tell me you still plan on capturing her!",
        "60723" : "Teehee... Like how I've grown? THIS is my true potential!",
        "59734" : "I think I understand what happened now. Now it's just a matter of determining a suitable punishment...",
        "60722" : "Her power is so strong it's filling the whole area with evil energy!",
        "59737" : "Although...if there are no reports of damage, she'll likely get off with just a warning. What do you think, Mikazuki? You're the victim here, after all.",
        "60721" : "Wha...? What's happening?!",
        "59736" : "A crime is a crime, my dear. And I've got to file a full police report.",
        "60720" : "But I guess I've gotta go all in on this one!",
        "59731" : "But she got really nervous when she first met Mikazuki... That's why she ran off.",
        "59730" : "The plan was simply to search for Mikazuki while Naphula caused a distraction.",
        "59733" : "Agh... This is so humiliating...",
        "59732" : "Afterwards she calmed down and decided to go for it one more time...but things just spiraled out of control.",
        "59739" : "Right, Luzon?",
        "59738" : "I am the victim of nothing more than very aggressive flirting! No harm has been incurred whatsoever.",
        "59740" : "I don't have any complaints. There's been no damage, after all... And I think I can soothe the feelings of anyone who objects.",
        "60729" : "Using up my reserves was worth it to see the looks on your faces right now! Teehee!",
        "60728" : "Ngh... How dare you...!",
        "60727" : "Teehee...! Get it, yet...? You can never hope to beat me!",
        "60726" : "After all that work to make the children smile, now look at them...",
        "60725" : "Wah...WAAHHHHH! It's scary, I wanna go hoooome!!!",
        "60735" : "Ergh... We were so close...!",
        "59746" : "It's not closed yet. We haven't secured the premises from a certain group of unwanted intruders...",
        "60734" : "Teeheehee! Looks like the tables have turned in my favor...!",
        "59745" : "And they're off. Another case closed...",
        "60733" : "Even so, we can't lose here!",
        "59748" : "We can't allow visitors inside until every last evil brute is gone.",
        "60732" : "She's super powerful! One slip-up, and we're toast...!",
        "59747" : "Grrrr...",
        "60731" : "We won't lose!\n{Username}, everyone...time to finish the job!",
        "59742" : "Alright! So that means everything's settled and Doppella can go free now!",
        "60730" : "Now... Time for YOU to be mashed into potatoes!",
        "59741" : "But I WOULD like to have her work as a volunteer at the exhibition as a form of punishment.",
        "59744" : "Hehe... Well, let's get going then.",
        "59743" : "Thank you so much, everyone...!",
        "59749" : "That's true. Alright, Master, this is our last job as supervisors of the exhibition!",
        "59751" : "Good idea, Tuna. You can leave the ones here to us!",
        "59750" : "There's still a lot left...! Let's divide up the work to get it done faster!",
        "60739" : "Teehee! All this delicious fear, just for me! What a treat!",
        "60738" : "Waaaaah! Why, Mama? Make it stop, it's too scary!",
        "60737" : "What, the kiddos? Yeah, they're absolutely terrified! Teehee!",
        "60736" : "The evil energy is too thick! It's wearing down our strength! And not to mention...",
        "60746" : "Huh? Look at what...?",
        "59757" : "Hello. I'm very sorry for the delay...",
        "60745" : "I'm fine... More importantly, look around you...",
        "59756" : "Looks like someone just arrived...",
        "60744" : "Snow White...! Are you okay?!",
        "59759" : "...I beg your pardon? As you can see, I've only just arrived. And more importantly, how did you know my name?",
        "60743" : "...UGH!",
        "59758" : "Oh, Zenimaru! Did you forget something?",
        "60742" : "Let's start by knocking out the tiredest of them all... RUTABAGA PUNCH!",
        "59753" : "Alright, let's head after Tuna and take care of any other ones...",
        "60741" : "Yup! Teehee! This is where your story ends...forever!",
        "59752" : "Mission complete! I don't sense any more evil brutes in the area!",
        "60740" : "I think we're...running out of luck...!",
        "59755" : "Apologies for being so late. Could you point me to the person in charge?",
        "59754" : "Yeah! This is the last step, and then we're—",
        "59243" : "We should take this threat seriously and do our best to uphold our duties.",
        "59242" : "It could be a copycat, who knows... Either way, we were sent here to make sure nothing goes wrong.",
        "59245" : "So, judging by the note, it sounds like he plans to steal the Mikazuki Munechika sword, right?",
        "59244" : "You're right, Lu. We can't let anything bother all the people who just want to enjoy the exhibition.",
        "59241" : "I thought he'd retired now and become some sort of traveling adventurer instead...",
        "59240" : "This must be THE Lupin, right, Master?",
        "60239" : "Teehee... Teeheehee!",
        "60238" : "Call it whatever you want, but you must be stopped...for the sake of all the children out there!",
        "60237" : "All of you against poor little me...? This is the epitome of unfairness!",
        "60236" : "I wish everyone would stop fighting... So I'll do my best to help get it over with as soon as possible!",
        "59247" : "It's no exaggeration to say that both the spirit and the sword are of equally great value.",
        "60235" : "Darned skippy! We'll fight like mean old lions! ...PS, Glinda, keep an eye on us, okay?",
        "59246" : "Not necessarily... For all we know he might be after Mikazuki himself.",
        "60234" : "Rutabaga has no chance of beating you in a head-on fight, Master!",
        "59249" : "Whether he's after me or the blade, it's no cause for alarm.",
        "60233" : "Go ahead if you think you're really strong enough to stop me! Teehee!",
        "59248" : "Haha, how kind of you to value me so highly! But you don't need to worry about that silly message.",
        "60232" : "We'll capture you and force you to turn all the reading machines back to normal if it's the last thing we do!",
        "60231" : "Have it your way...but you're the one who's going to get beaten!",
        "60230" : "Teehee... Yeah, right! I just thought I'd beat you down with my own hands to save my clones the trouble!",
        "59254" : "I was dispatched from overseas to apprehend Lupin.",
        "59253" : "Ah, where are my manners! My name's Zenimaru.",
        "59256" : "I can't go into too much detail, but I'm sure you can understand with a little help from your imagination.",
        "59255" : "D-dispatched...? Who are you, anyway?",
        "59250" : "You protect the sword, {Username}, and I'll protect myself, okay?",
        "59252" : "Wh-who said that?",
        "59251" : "I wouldn't underestimate Lupin if I were you.",
        "60249" : "Come on! Cancel those spells already!",
        "60248" : "...Teehee.",
        "60247" : "Now fix our stories, right this instant!",
        "59258" : "And before Lupin retired, I was the closest to catching him. So it would probably be best to leave everything to me today.",
        "60246" : "All we want is for you to turn the reading machines back to normal and promise never to do anything like that again.",
        "59257" : "Let's just say that I and my team are specialists in criminal investigation and security.",
        "60245" : "H-hey, watch it! You're the bad guy here, not us!",
        "60244" : "Goodness graaacious! I don't even WANT to think about what you're gonna do to me now!",
        "59259" : "Okay... But I think we need to run all of this by the Bureau of the Occult, first.",
        "60243" : "Phew... We finally pinned her down.",
        "60242" : "Oh noooooo! I loooooost!",
        "60241" : "This is weird... I feel like we're winning, but check out that look on her face...",
        "60240" : "...Teehee!",
        "59265" : "And what an exit... Don't think I mind being under the protection of someone who looks like that.",
        "59264" : "Heh, I appreciate it. Then you're now officially under my protection!",
        "59267" : "Come now! I'm always an utter professional focused on the mission at hand.",
        "59266" : "Um, Mikazuki... I hope you're not thinking anything, er, unprofessional...?",
        "59261" : "...I just checked with the Bureau, and everything she says is true.",
        "59260" : "Of course. That's why I've already spoken with them.",
        "59263" : "Having to be watched over doesn't sit well with me... But if she did come all this way from abroad, so I guess I can put up with it.",
        "59262" : "So then, how about leaving the protection to me?",
        "60259" : "Now it's time for the real battle to begin...! And this time I'll REALLY make you angry!",
        "60258" : "Right you are! You know, it's weird how you can be so clever, yet at the same time so deliciously gullible!",
        "59269" : "Grrr...",
        "60257" : "She had her clones do her dirty work while we were busy with battle!",
        "59268" : "Wait... Who's there? Who dares to enter my exhibition room?",
        "60256" : "Look around...? Oh my gosh, those children are crying!",
        "60255" : "Of COURSE I was only pretending! Now look around and see what you missed in the meantime!",
        "60254" : "I swear, you guys are just SO easy to fool! I love it!",
        "60253" : "What the...? She was only pretending to be exhausted!",
        "60252" : "Mainly 'cause I haven't lost yet!",
        "60251" : "B-but...I don't wanna give up...",
        "60250" : "Listen to her! You've got nowhere left to run or hide, Rutabaga! Give up already!",
        "59270" : "How can we be under attack...? I thought Zenimaru was supposed to keep the place safe!",
        "59276" : "Maybe this was one of Lupin's tricks?",
        "59275" : "But wasn't that \"specialist\" supposed to be protecting the building?",
        "59278" : "In any case, let's stay on standby till we hear back from Zenimaru.",
        "59277" : "...Maybe. Something definitely smells suspicious if you ask me.",
        "59272" : "Only hotties are allowed in here without permission.",
        "59271" : "I won't stand for troublemakers in my exhibition... You'll have to be forcibly removed.",
        "59274" : "There! No more evil brutes are left to disrupt the exhibition!",
        "59273" : "More fighting, fewer HR violations, okay, Mikazuki?",
        "60269" : "We get out of one pickle only to end up in another! What is this place—a pickle factory?!",
        "60268" : "Meanwhile we're about to be overrun by her pesky clones...",
        "59279" : "Good idea. It'll be safer for you and your sword if we stay close.",
        "60267" : "Grr...! I wish she would just keep her mouth shut!",
        "60266" : "I'm getting bored of dealing with you... I think I'll leave the rest to my clones. Ta-ta!",
        "60265" : "At this rate, I won't need to so much as lift a finger.",
        "60264" : "Ergh...!",
        "60263" : "What's wrong, dearies? Where's all the fighting spirit you were filled with earlier?",
        "60262" : "We can't afford to let our attention slip for even one moment...",
        "60261" : "Her power, it's...it's like...so...AGH! I can't even think of a funny one-liner to describe it!",
        "60260" : "Ulp! She isn't kidding... I'm sensing power far beyond anything we've faced so far!",
        "59281" : "That's what you say, but—\nAh, the lights! Now is NOT the time for a power outage!",
        "59280" : "I can protect myself and the sword just fine without any help, you know.",
        "59287" : "Lupin... Pretty brave to follow through with that silly message of yours.",
        "59286" : "Hah! If this is secure, I'd hate to see what's normal!",
        "59289" : "So you're after me and not the sword after all... Fine with me! Bring it on, thief!",
        "59288" : "I always follow through with my promises... And so tonight I will make you mine, Mikazuki!",
        "59283" : "It is I, the great thief Arsène Lupin! I've come, just as promised!",
        "59282" : "Calm down... The backup generator should kick in any minute.",
        "59285" : "Zenimaru was supposed to have secured the whole place!",
        "59284" : "L-Lupin?! How'd you get in here?!",
        "60279" : "I trust you are feeling better? If so, I should also like to help you with the fighting if it is not overly troublesome.",
        "60278" : "Wow, I'm brimming with energy! Now we might actually have a chance!",
        "60277" : "...Is this magic?",
        "60276" : "That is quite fortunate. Healing happens to be a specialty of mine.\nBibbity, bobbity...boo!",
        "60275" : "Th-thank you so much...! We were on the verge of running out of energy ourselves, to tell the truth...",
        "60274" : "My name is Cinderella. But let's save the detailed introductions until after the fighting is concluded.",
        "60273" : "Wow, she's beautiful...! Could I ask your name, ma'am?",
        "60272" : "How are you faring with your...ahem...root vegetable problem?",
        "60271" : "How do you do? Please pardon the pumpkin carriage.",
        "60270" : "Okay, enough with the pickle analogies, I—\nHuh? Is that a horse-drawn pumpkin coming this way...?",
        "59290" : "Hehe, looks like the target of today's extraction is a lively one! I love it!",
        "59292" : "And now, evil brutes? Come on, {Username}, let's take care of them!",
        "59291" : "Grrr...",
        "59298" : "Oh, I was just stopping by to say hello. But now I must be going. Gotta leave you wanting more, hmm?",
        "59297" : "Flattery from another man's totally wasted on me. You're the one who should be a good boy and turn yourself in already.",
        "59299" : "Hmph... So now he's just gonna run away?",
        "59294" : "Don't be stupid. I'd only let someone capture me if they were a total hottie.",
        "59293" : "Mikazuki, why won't you be a good boy and come with me peacefully?",
        "59296" : "...And that's exactly what makes it so much fun.",
        "59295" : "Ahh, I knew capturing one of the Five Great Blades would be no ordinary job.",
        "60289" : "...Alright. We shall take you at your word.",
        "60288" : "But I'm serious! I'll do whatever you want! I PROMISE I won't stab you in the back this time!",
        "60287" : "Yeah, right! Can't fool us the same way twice!",
        "60286" : "Please, I'm begging you! Let me go free, and I promise I'll help you!",
        "60285" : "W-wait, wait! The real Rutabaga made me do it! She FORCED me to!",
        "60284" : "It seems that you are the only one left. Will we need to do this the hard way?",
        "60283" : "AGH!",
        "60282" : "You're a huge help either way...!\nNow we can really focus on winning, Master!",
        "60281" : "Offensive blows are not my forte, but I will do my best to keep your backs covered.",
        "60280" : "That would be wonderful...! We are truly indebted to you! Just follow my lead on the attack!",
        "60290" : "R-really? Woohoo! Teehee...",
        "60299" : "Ah, we chitter here like mice when I could be summoning a carriage. One we can all fit in...\nBibbity boo!",
        "60298" : "You really have been an invaluable help. I—",
        "60297" : "Amazing. You really are incredible, Cinderella...in more ways than one!",
        "60296" : "She's telling the truth. The spell I cast on her confirms it.",
        "60295" : "Well...it works the other way, too. Children's smiles and happiness make Rutabaga weaker...",
        "60294" : "Um, okay! So...you know how we get strength from children's fear, right?",
        "60293" : "Alright, Rutaclona! If you're really on our side, then tell us what Rutabaga's weakness is!",
        "60292" : "Ulp! D-don't worry, you can trust me!",
        "60291" : "Mind that I shall be using my magic to observe everything you do. So if you don't hold true to your promise...",
        "59641" : "Ugh! I can't believe you just went there, Mikazuki...",
        "59640" : "She was pretty darn cute, that's for sure... I wonder if I could get her number?",
        "60629" : "I know she's trying hard, but maybe someone else should've been on provocation duty... Do you think Rutabaga will even show up?",
        "60628" : "If, if she doesn't like it, then maybe she should come and try to beat me this time! That...that, big jerk dummy!",
        "60627" : "Rutabaga really is a big pushover! We've been fighting all day, and I'm still fine!",
        "60626" : "Everything's ready to go. Now, how to provoke Rutabaga...? Hmm...ah, I know!",
        "60636" : "I don't care how many of you there are... You're all just clones of the same dummy!",
        "59647" : "There's nowhere for you to go now, Lupin! Just hold still and let me tie you up!",
        "60635" : "*pant, pant*\nIt's okay... I'm fine, perfectly fine!",
        "59646" : "Looks like they've really got us trapped, huh.",
        "60634" : "You're using too much of your magic, Miss Cinderella...",
        "59649" : "Naphula...",
        "60633" : "Look at all those clones coming together! Snow White's act turned out to be super effective!",
        "59648" : "Oh, no you don't... Not yet!",
        "60632" : "I need to grab more of their attention... Umm...\nN-no, you! You're the dumb meanie!",
        "59643" : "Great idea, Luzon!",
        "60631" : "...Looks like it worked.",
        "59642" : "...I asked de' Medici to block the path ahead, so now he has nowhere left to run.",
        "60630" : "Who are you calling a big jerk dummy?! Only dumb jerks call people dumb jerks, so there! You're the dummy!",
        "59645" : "Damn, everywhere we turn they've got militia members blocking the way...!",
        "59644" : "LUPIN! WAAAIIIT!",
        "59650" : "Time for you to come out, my evil brutes!",
        "59652" : "What in the world...?! Evil brutes are climbing in through the windows! I thought they were locked!",
        "59651" : "Grrr...",
        "60639" : "Yes. It's all part of the plan...",
        "60638" : "They're coming this way...! There sure are a lot of them...",
        "60637" : "Don't you call me a dummy! And if you really aren't scared of my clones, I'll show you why you should be!",
        "60647" : "Certainly not! Are you kidding me?",
        "59658" : "Oh, no! Evil brutes with increased manual dexterity are coming for us! Somebody save us!",
        "60646" : "Could you make an announcement about the fireworks before we launch them? Just to explain what's going on, like an emcee...",
        "59657" : "...Anyway, my evil brutes' manual dexterity will be your downfall! Hahaha!",
        "60645" : "Thank you! ...And we have one more request. Actually, we were wondering...",
        "60644" : "And all you need is official permission from the Bureau of the Occult? Consider it done.",
        "59659" : "I can't tell if she's being sarcastic...",
        "60643" : "...So, you want to launch fireworks to make the kids happy?",
        "59654" : "I've used my special powers to increase their manual dexterity!",
        "60642" : "...And also ask Mikado to make the announcement to the kids!",
        "59653" : "Hehehe... And they're not just ordinary evil brutes, either! These guys are the cream of the crop!",
        "60641" : "Right! Come on, Master, let's call them up and request permission to use fireworks...",
        "59656" : "B-but, doesn't it sound cool? It's really useful, too! I promise!",
        "60640" : "And while I'm distracting them, you should be calling the Bureau of the Occult!",
        "59655" : "Manual dexterity? That's...really specific.",
        "59661" : "I'm getting a bad feeling about where this is going...",
        "59660" : "You don't realize what you're doing, Naphula. Let me open your eyes to the truth!",
        "59663" : "You're so...so strong!",
        "59662" : "This is the last battle. I hope you're ready, Naphula.",
        "60649" : "More like dead wrong! I would never do something like that... Anyway, permission to launch the fireworks is granted.",
        "60648" : "The announcement will make everyone feel happier! I'm dead serious!",
        "60658" : "This might hurt, so brace yourself...!\nPrincess Power...POUR! Pour into our allies!",
        "59669" : "How can you even suggest such a thing?! And right in front of Lupin, too!",
        "60657" : "Thank you...\nNow! With our magic let us grant strength to Snow White and the spirit agents!",
        "59668" : "Wh-wh-what the hell are you talking about?!",
        "60656" : "...Okay. But this is the last time I do this.",
        "60655" : "I said it's alright...! Can't you see everyone else is struggling, too?",
        "60654" : "B-but...if you push yourself any further with your magic...!",
        "59665" : "No, Lupin! You can't give up yet!",
        "60653" : "...Lend me your power one more time, Glassie.",
        "59664" : "It's over, Naphula...",
        "60652" : "Uh-oh, Snow White needs our help! ...But we need to call Mikado back, too!",
        "59667" : "But there's still time to change. You can still come running into my arms instead.",
        "60651" : "Ergh...! I'm not getting anywhere with these clones!",
        "59666" : "You know what your biggest mistake is, Naphula? Your choice in men.",
        "60650" : "W-wait!\n...Urgh, she hung up. NOW what do we do, Master?!",
        "59672" : "Lupin! There's nothing to be gained by capturing a man like this! He's complete trash, worthless!",
        "59671" : "Naphula... This is all a misunderstanding. I am the most earnest, respectful—",
        "59674" : "Why did you even choose to go after him...?!",
        "59673" : "I w-wouldn't go that far...",
        "59670" : "You're just as shallow as the rumors said!",
        "60659" : "What's this strength I'm feeling all of a sudden?\n{Username}... Whatever it is, let's use this to finish them off!",
        "60669" : "How can you...ugh! We're not talking about the Bureau of the Occult!",
        "60668" : "Even if it's just my voice, interacting with normal humans would cause major problems at the Bureau!",
        "59679" : "So who's side is she on now...?",
        "60667" : "...That doesn't mean I like what you're asking me to do.",
        "60666" : "...Mikado. Can you hear me? We're in big trouble over here!",
        "60665" : "*pant, pant*\n...It wasn't too much...I'll see this through to the end!",
        "59676" : "Wait...what? Did Lupin just say what I think he said?",
        "60664" : "Cinderella! What's wrong?! Was that last burst of magic too much...?!",
        "59675" : "Well...I just started to feel this intense longing, and...it all happened so fast... You can't blame me!",
        "60663" : "You can make hundreds of thousands of clones if you want! We won't stop until all the children are smiling! ...Ergh!",
        "59678" : "That man is an enemy of all women, Lupin! I'll show you!",
        "60662" : "You guys are the WORST! I could create hundreds of clones and you'd probably STILL beat 'em all!",
        "59677" : "I had no idea that Lupin was...",
        "60661" : "I've gotta do my best, too! So I'm gonna call Mikado back one more time!",
        "60660" : "Oh, Master! You and Snow White...and Cinderella, too... You're all trying so hard to make this work! This is amazing!",
        "59683" : "Shut up! As a self-respecting woman, this is the only option left to me!",
        "59682" : "Come on now, Naphula! We could be doing so many other things besides fighting!",
        "59685" : "Sheesh... I'm surrounded by women who don't know how to calm down and play nice.",
        "59684" : "...I see. Then as a proper man, I'll take them straight on.",
        "59681" : "...Prepare yourself. It's well past time I beat some sense into you!",
        "59680" : "I'm not really sure anymore, to be honest...",
        "60679" : "So I've got a fun little surprise for you! Just turn your eyes to the sky and watch!",
        "60678" : "The festival's become a bit of a downer with all these scary stories, hasn't it?",
        "60677" : "Attention, visitors to the festival! Good afternoon! This is Miss Mikado speaking!",
        "60676" : "Huh? That voice... It's Mikado's voice on the loud speaker!",
        "59687" : "...You've shown me how strongly you feel about all of this, Naphula.",
        "60675" : "Testing, one-two... Is this on?",
        "59686" : "I think we're being extremely calm and nice, considering we have to deal with you...",
        "60674" : "I'll handle it myself! I might get in trouble for it later...but I don't care anymore!",
        "59689" : "All I wanted was a little retaliation, that's all...but I guess I can't accomplish anything on my own...",
        "60673" : "Great news, Ms. Ridinghood!\nBut what about the announcement...?",
        "59688" : "But that's enough. Just give it a rest now.",
        "60672" : "Sorry to keep you waitin'! All the fireworks are ready to go now, and I hear we've got permission, too.",
        "60671" : "Sola—\n...She just hung up on me!",
        "60670" : "I'm talking about what's going on at the festival!\nUgh, forget it!",
        "59694" : "What are you waiting for, Mikazuki? Go ahead and show the kind of man you really are!",
        "59693" : "Do...whatever we want with you...?",
        "59696" : "Yeah, Mikazuki's not like that, Naphula. He might be shallow, but he's not that bad of a guy.",
        "59695" : "I think you've got me all wrong...",
        "59690" : "Naphula...",
        "59692" : "I lost, so you can do whatever you want with me...but I'll always feel the same way inside!",
        "59691" : "I just hate Mikazuki so much! He's an enemy of all women...!",
        "60207" : "Wow, Master! Poisona is a nice person after all!",
        "60206" : "Even if an enemy is the one that's getting hurt... It just makes me sad to see it.",
        "60689" : "Looks like it worked!",
        "60205" : "What a pity... But even if we have to fight, let's keep the use of force to a minimum, okay? I don't like violence.",
        "60688" : "We showed those Rutabagas who's boss! And I don't see any reinforcements in sight!",
        "60204" : "Agreed. I don't think words are gonna work on Rutabaga either.",
        "60687" : "You did a great job, Mikado! Thank you so much!",
        "60203" : "I'd love to help...but it's gonna take more than nice words and apples to solve today's fiasco.",
        "59698" : "She's right. He may be a bit trashy, but he's got a good heart.",
        "60686" : "Glad that's over... And just so you know, I am NEVER doing that again, {Username}.",
        "60202" : "Nice one, Poisona! How about sticking around and helping us a bit longer?",
        "59697" : "...What?",
        "60685" : "This is our chance! Let's put a stop to Rutabaga's plan, once and for all!",
        "60201" : "For me? Don't mind if I do...\n*chomp, chomp*\n...Zzz...",
        "60684" : "Wh-what's going on? My power's fading away...!",
        "60200" : "...Hey you, monster over there. How about a delicious apple?",
        "59699" : "Wow, Dojigiri...and Shosoin... I had no idea you both liked me so much!",
        "60683" : "We did it! The fireworks are going off without a hitch and all the children are smiling...!",
        "60682" : "Wow! Mommy, it's fireworks! Look at all the pretty colors!",
        "60681" : "Alright...here we go!",
        "60680" : "Mikado actually pulled through...!",
        "60209" : "Hehe... Don't worry about it. I'm used to being misunderstood.",
        "60208" : "I'm sorry for being scared of you at first, Poisona.",
        "60218" : "I won't let a couple of spirit agents tell me what to do! You're the one who need to be stopped once and for all!",
        "60217" : "And all that is about to stop, once and for all! This ends NOW!",
        "60216" : "I can feel the nourishment fueling me, making me stronger! Making my skin smooth and blemish-free!",
        "60699" : "Yeah! Me and Master are REALLY pissed off!",
        "60215" : "W-well...while you sit here blabbing, my twisted tales are scaring children by the dozens! So THERE!",
        "60698" : "And we have nothing to pay for. You've done more to make us angry than we've ever done to you!",
        "60214" : "I thought we weren't gonna talk about that, Snow White! Zip those lips!",
        "60697" : "Bluff all you want, but it's time for you to retire this sad act of yours.",
        "60213" : "We ARE the ones who walked right into her trap in the first place...",
        "60696" : "I may be a little weaker, but beating you guys'll still be a piece of cake! I'm gonna make you pay for what you did!",
        "60212" : "Silly Rutabaga monster! You shouldn't be so careless!",
        "60695" : "The real Rutabaga! Finally, you show yourself!",
        "60211" : "We walked right out the door, of course! You should really remember to lock it next time, hehe...",
        "60694" : "I worked so hard to make those children scared out of their wits...and now in one instant they're all smiles!",
        "60210" : "Wh-whaaat?! You spirit agents again?! How'd you get out of that room?!",
        "60693" : "...You guys are REALLY starting to piss me off!",
        "60692" : "Mission accomplished, hehe! And look how happy all the children are! Oh, this is wonderful!",
        "60691" : "Rutabaga lost her powers, just like we expected!",
        "60690" : "Yeah! Thanks everyone for your help with this!",
        "60219" : "Get them, super clones!\nThese are my strongest clones EVER! HAHAHA!",
        "60229" : "Thanks for the cooperation. Does this mean you're ready to surrender?",

        "60227" : "Teehee... Well, when you put it like that, I can't say no...!",
        "60226" : "Watching us fight from the sidelines is cowardly, Rutabaga! Come and face us directly for a change!",
        "60225" : "No matter how many clones we beat we don't get any closer to her...",
        "60224" : "...I think I can see why Rutabaga gets on your nerves so much. She needs to learn the value of silence.",
        "60223" : "Are you sure you're okay? Aren't you starting to get tired? I'm just so WORRIED about you!",
        "59238" : "Just when we'd finally gotten everything ready for the Five Great Blades Exhibition, we get this weird message...",
        "60222" : "Teehee! Getting angry, are we? Too bad you're not even halfway through my super clones!",
        "59237" : "[The Mikazuki Munechika Exhibition Room]",
        "60221" : "Yeah! Your super clones are super LAME!",
        "60220" : "These clones really are super strong...but nothing can stop us!",
        "59801" : "Well...what if Lupin and Doppella were working together all along?",
        "59800" : "Huh? What do you mean?",
        "59803" : "Enough with the conspiracy theories! I don't care whether it's a trap, a slap, or a whole bunch of crap, I'm going!",
        "59802" : "Maybe Doppella only pretended to be captured in order to lure Mikazuki here, and then—",
        "59809" : "But of course! Why should I have any cause for concern?",
        "59808" : "You seem pretty carefree considering we've got you cornered, Lupin.",
        "59805" : "You guys worry too much. We'll figure everything out once we get there!",
        "59804" : "...I see. Alright, then, let's keep moving.",
        "59807" : "Mikazuki, you came...!",
        "59806" : "Well, well... You're early.",
        "60801" : "Ooh! Hey Mommy, look at this one! I wanna be a character in it!",
        "59812" : "That truth doesn't change, even if the \"Lupin\" is an imposter.",
        "60800" : "Remember, you can always pick up a copy of your favorite picture book as a souvenir! Isn't that exciting? Thanks again for coming today!",
        "59811" : "The reason is simple. The great thief Lupin never fails.",
        "59814" : "...And you think I'm gonna let you get away with that?",
        "59813" : "However, she failed, using my name! So it's time for a little punishment.",
        "59810" : "The REAL Lupin turned his back on being a thief! So what's going on here?!",
        "59819" : "Hehe... About that...",
        "59816" : "She lied to you. Whatever reason she had, it doesn't change the fact that she intentionally deceived you.",
        "59815" : "Why should you even care? What reason do you have to help this girl?",
        "59818" : "...Enough talking. Hand over Doppella, now.",
        "59817" : "In fact, maybe she just came up with that lovey-dovey excuse knowing you'd lighten her sentence...?",
        "60809" : "A...slumber party?",
        "60808" : "I, I wanted to ask Snow White something... To, to celebrate our victory, how about we have a slumber party, just us girls?",
        "60807" : "Yeah!\n...Huh? Cinderella, you look like you've got something to say.",
        "60806" : "So I want to make sure those smiles never disappear from their faces again.",
        "60805" : "The children who enjoy our stories are as important to us as if they were our very own children.",
        "60804" : "Yeah, it sucks. I can't squeeze even a little nourishment from them.",
        "60803" : "You really were the bad guy, though. Plus, the children look so happy...",
        "60802" : "So painting me as the bad guy and making the kids happy was all part of your plan to sell books? Unbelievable...",
        "60812" : "Yeah! We can all wear pajamas and eat popcorn, just like in the movies!",
        "59823" : "Hmph, so the brutes do the fighting while you just watch from safety?",
        "60811" : "Works for me... It's been awhile since I had a good night of girl talk!",
        "59822" : "Don't go disappointing me now...okay?",
        "60810" : "Ohh, a slumber party sounds like fun!",
        "59825" : "We're done with your distractions. Now it's time you deal with us directly.",
        "59824" : "Heh... This is just the trial run. I can't be bothered to face you if you can't handle this much.",
        "59821" : "Grrrr...",
        "59820" : "Why don't we make the usual villain's bargain? You know, \"You can have the girl if you defeat me\"?",
        "59827" : "But do you honestly think Doppella really likes you?",
        "59826" : "...Impressive. Maybe I won't be able to capture you after all, hehe.",
        "59829" : "...Didn't you hear me say I've had enough of your lectures?",
        "59828" : "Do you REALLY trust her? She might've been lying to you this whole time, you know.",
        "60819" : "We didn't expect you to give such an amazing performance either!",
        "60818" : "I can't believe what I did... Talk about out of character!",
        "60817" : "That sure escalated quickly, considering we were just supposed to be making the rounds.",
        "60816" : "[Bureau of the Occult]",
        "60815" : "...",
        "60814" : "S-slow down! You're all acting like this slumber party is already a real thing!",
        "60813" : "Hehe... I could use some new pajamas, come to think of it....",
        "60823" : "Anyway... Great job to both of you.",
        "59834" : "Oh, Mikazuki... This is all because of me!",
        "60822" : "WHAAAT?!",
        "59833" : "Mikazuki's losing ground...! This is not good!",
        "60821" : "Remember it, since you won't hear it again, okay? And I'm deducting money from your salaries to reimburse me for my services.",
        "59836" : "Naphula...?",
        "60820" : "You were a complete natural, Mikado! Even we could feel the excitement!",
        "59835" : "This is no time to be hard on yourself, Doppella!",
        "59830" : "Aww, not taking the bait, huh? Then let's cut to the chase!",
        "59832" : "So you want me to free the girl now, is that it?",
        "59831" : "Ngh...! You're not half bad, Lupin...",
        "59838" : "...Right. Thanks, Naphula! This time I'm gonna be strong!",
        "59837" : "You've told enough lies for one day. How about finally being honest for a change?",

        "59863" : "Do you really expect me to stop just because you told me to? Hehe...",
        "59862" : "I won't let you go any further, Lupin! Hold it right there!",

        "59367" : "We're gonna set Mikazuki free, just watch us!",
        "60355" : "We'll make sure you don't regret letting us stick around!",
        "60354" : "...Big words. I won't be babysittin' you if you choose to stay. You'll have to cover your own butts.",
        "59369" : "We won! Now, set Mikazuki free!",
        "60353" : "No, we'll stay and help you. We know what it feels like to want to protect your story at all costs...",
        "60352" : "I think it's time to bust out the big guns... You kids run on ahead. I'll finish takin' out this trash.",
        "60351" : "Y-you haven't b-beaten us yet! W-we're gonna show you who's b-boss!",
        "60350" : "Boss Ridinghood's got a heck of a presence! Even Rutabaga's starting to shrivel up!",
        "59375" : "Don't tell me he slipped out of the ropes by himself...",
        "59374" : "Hey, how did Mikazuki get free?!",
        "59377" : "Typical...! He always manages to escape at the very last second.",
        "59376" : "Thanks for keeping her busy so I could get free, {Username}.",
        "59371" : "Huh? What happened to the ropes...?",
        "59370" : "I'm afraid I can't do that. You see, I have a very special situa—",
        "59373" : "...When you should never take your eyes off a sexy guy like me!",
        "59372" : "You let {Username} distract you...",
        "60369" : "Whoa... I feel like I just had a vision of the Virgin Mary!",
        "60368" : "Snow White, that was so beautifully put!",
        "59379" : "Again? I was never in love with you to begin with!",
        "60367" : "And that's why it's personally important for me to keep everything safe around here...!",
        "59378" : "In love with me all over again, eh, Mitsuyo?",
        "60366" : "We want to protect the folktales and turn them back to normal...and make all the children smile again! That's my goal!",
        "60365" : "What...?!",
        "60364" : "Helping you IS part of our bigger goal...",
        "60363" : "And don't you have bigger fish to fry? Why are you still hangin' around here, anyway?",
        "60362" : "It'd be disgraceful to accept help from a bunch of outsiders like you...",
        "60361" : "W-wait a minute, please! I'm sure we can handle this situation without doing anything rash if we work together!",
        "60360" : "My fairy tale's important to all the wolves in my gang, too. As their boss, I gotta be willin' to give my own life for the cause.",
        "59380" : "Ouch, love hurts...",
        "59386" : "I wonder! I'll let you find that out on your own...",
        "59385" : "...What exactly do you mean by that?",
        "59388" : "Hee hee... I can't wait to see how things work out between you and Lupin...",
        "59387" : "Tsk, women and their secrets! Alright, I get the picture...",
        "59382" : "But I'm afraid our flirting ends here.",
        "59381" : "Anyway, I've enjoyed our time together, miss...",
        "59384" : "You might even be alright in the end... Hee hee hee.",
        "59383" : "Hee hee...indeed. I thought you were a simple ladies' man, but I can see there's more to you than that.",
        "60379" : "Thank you so much! I can't believe we really did it... We got on Boss Ridinghood's good side!",
        "60378" : "And I always pay back my debts. So lemme know if you ever need a favor...",
        "59389" : "Well THAT doesn't sound ominous at all...",
        "60377" : "You may be outsiders...but you really helped me out a lot back there.",
        "60376" : "We did it! We beat the clones!",
        "60375" : "Eeeek! Nope, can't do it! Retreat, RETREAT!",
        "60374" : "Everyone has things they gotta protect...and for me it's my turf! Time for me to put my muscles to work!",
        "60373" : "Wh-where did they get all this strength from...?!",
        "60372" : "So I'd better show some courage, too! Or else I'd lose the respect of my gang!",
        "60371" : "Most outsiders wouldn't dare to speak to me so casual...",
        "60370" : "I may not have a personal connection to any folktale, but I feel just as strongly as Snow White does! We have to protect all the stories!",
        "59391" : "Yes, hee hee... That much I can tell you.",
        "59390" : "So, Mona Lisa...you've been working with Lupin this whole time, right?",
        "59397" : "Oh, no you won't!\n...Master, why don't you do that instead?",
        "59396" : "So, until we find Zenimaru, I'll serve as Mona Lisa's personal escort, and—",
        "59399" : "But of course. Hee hee... Losers must bend to the will of victors, after all.",
        "59398" : "Um, sure! Come with us, Mona Lisa...and don't try any funny business!",
        "59393" : "Who said we had to do anything? She's not hurting anyone, and it's bad form to be rude to a lady.",
        "59392" : "Right. Hmm... What do you think we should we do with her, Master...?",
        "59395" : "Yeah, I guess that WOULD be the proper thing to do.",
        "59394" : "Oh, come on...! We should at least alert Zenimaru about this since she's in charge of everything!",
        "60389" : "I-I don't know what to say... But alright, I'm not opposed, if you're not.",
        "60388" : "Wow, Snow White sure is popular! I wonder if she'll be friends with us, too, Master!",
        "60387" : "Oh, really? I'm afraid she and I go quite a ways back...",
        "60386" : "Hey hey, should I get in on this, too? I mean, I've known her longer than any of you have!",
        "60385" : "I've been waiting ages and AGES just to meet her!",
        "60384" : "You...you mean you wish to be friends with her? Unacceptable, I've already called dibs!",
        "60383" : "I don't usually say this, but...I wouldn't mind meeting up with you again some time, one-on-one...",
        "60382" : "Actually, Snow White... Anyone ever told you you've got a lot of potential?",
        "60381" : "Um...okay... In any case, we appreciate your help!",
        "60380" : "You're better off not getting involved with someone like me long-term. Let's make this a one-time arrangement, see?",
        "60399" : "That's what one of the clones told us. So we were hoping your gang could help us fix all the reading machines all at once.",
        "60398" : "You said Rutabaga gets weaker when children smile instead of cry, right?",
        "60397" : "Alright... I think it's time we talk strategy.",
        "60396" : "Y-your grandmother taught you to do that...? Yikes!",
        "60395" : "C'mon, time to fit her for some cement shoes, just like my grandmother taught me.",
        "60394" : "Look who's here. Now we don't have to go find her to pay what she owes.",
        "60393" : "Teehee...! So? Whatcha doin' way out here?",
        "60392" : "But first things first, we got a pest to take care of.",
        "60391" : "...And you're invitin' me, too?",
        "60390" : "She said yes...! I can finally have the tea party I've been dreaming of!",
        "59760" : "You look like you've been through the wringer since the last time we saw you... What happened?",
        "59762" : "Anyway, could you update me on the situation? Have you located Lupin yet?",
        "59761" : "Traffic was at a standstill so I ran all the way here on foot...",
        "60749" : "As spirits based on children's favorite folktales we can't let them suffer like that!",
        "60748" : "The kids are bawling like crazy...!",
        "60747" : "Wah-wah...WAAAHH!",
        "60757" : "You persistent little pests! Hurry up and lose already!",
        "59768" : "\"I have captured the insolent fool who stole my identity.\n-Lupin the Thief\"",
        "60756" : "That's the ticket! Where there's a will, there's a way...that's what my grandmother always told me!",
        "59767" : "Looks like the backup system is up and running... And there's a note on the ground.",
        "60755" : "Hah... I've found more strength within me than I even imagined...!",
        "60754" : "Master... We've gotta muster all the strength we can!",
        "59769" : "That means...the real Lupin was after Doppella! And now he's got her!",
        "60753" : "What the hell...? They should be begging me to finish them off by now!",
        "59764" : "Wh-wh-WHAT?!",
        "60752" : "Folktales are meant to inspire dreams and bring smiles!",
        "59763" : "Lupin...? But didn't you just leave here with Doppella, who was impersonating him the whole time?",
        "60751" : "The power of folktales is meant to help children, not hurt them!",
        "59766" : "...A power outage? Not again...!",
        "60750" : "Ah... You're absolutely right.",
        "59765" : "You idiot, that was the REAL Lupin!",
        "59771" : "Evil brutes are upon us! Prepare for battle, everyone!",
        "59770" : "Grrrr...",
        "59773" : "Ugh! He's pulled the wool over my eyes once again!",
        "59772" : "That jerk...! What's he got planned for Doppella?!",
        "60759" : "Yeah! No matter how much strength you summon, by the last page the villain will get what they deserve!",
        "60758" : "Hah! You haven't figured it out by now? This's no Grimm story. Nowadays you can't beat the hero!",
        "60768" : "Could put your voices together and cheer for the good guys? Then they can change the stories back to how they're supposed to go!",
        "59779" : "I'll come as soon as I've explained the situation to my team. Until then...",
        "60767" : "And the bad guy is sooo strong that the heroes are about to lose...!",
        "59778" : "And we're coming with you! Right, Master?",
        "60766" : "Actually...right now the brave heroes of justice are fighting a big bad guy, the one who changed all your favorite folktales into scary stories!",
        "60765" : "Huh...?",
        "60764" : "Ding dong! Who's there? It's me again, everyone's favorite Miss Mikado! And I'm back to ask a favor!",
        "59775" : "I can't believe he even dressed up like me... That idiot's gone too far this time!",
        "60763" : "Give it up, losers—",
        "59774" : "I guess Lupin really is a top-class criminal...",
        "60762" : "I know!\n...Hello, Mikado? Could I ask you one more favor...pretty please?",
        "59777" : "That's it... I'm going after Lupin. I can't let him make off with Doppella.",
        "60761" : "We're almost there, Master! We've just gotta put the children at ease somehow...",
        "59776" : "I can't believe the real Lupin was the friend we made along the way...",
        "60760" : "Ugh! I hate heroes! They're always giving us bad guys a bad time!",
        "59782" : "Zenimaru's doing what she can to help. So let's hurry up and get moving ourselves!",
        "59781" : "You know, I get the funny feeling we've met before... Anyway, I'll meet up with you later!",
        "59784" : "...I found him! Looks like they're still nearby!",
        "59300" : "More importantly, if all those evil brutes got inside the building, what on Earth is going on with security?",
        "59783" : "Wait! Let me check the security footage first!",
        "59780" : "You don't need to get your team involved... 'Cause I'll handle everything all by myself.",
        "60769" : "*sniff...*\nOkay, Miss Mikado!",
        "60779" : "Rrgh... I think it's time I get outta here... Ta-ta!",
        "59306" : "The Five Great Swords are only the beginning... If we're not careful other works of art might get damaged, too!",
        "60778" : "You dumb kids! Why'd you have to get all happy and starry-eyed from that stupid announcement?!",
        "59789" : "It probably is a trap...but that's no excuse not to help Doppella! You know what I mean, don't you, {Username}?",
        "59305" : "Ack! We have to inform Zenimaru of this immediately!",
        "60777" : "Dammit...! My strength's draining right out of me!",
        "59308" : "No, I'll stick with you. I've gotta make sure the lovely Zenimaru didn't get hurt and is in need of some hurt/comfort...",
        "60776" : "Rrgh! I'm gonna destroy you all before my powers disappear...!",
        "59307" : "And then the exhibition won't be able to be held at all... Mikazuki, you've gotta get out of here!",
        "60775" : "The \"Miss Mikado Plan\" worked! The children are all smiling and cheering, and Rutabaga's getting weaker!",
        "59786" : "So, he's the type that likes filming himself for other people to watch, eh? Absolutely disgusting!",
        "59302" : "[Gates of Hell Exhibition Hall]",
        "60774" : "Yes! Suddenly I have the strength to go on!",
        "59785" : "You mean he let himself be caught on tape?!",
        "59301" : "Maybe we should go check things out... Come on, Master!",
        "60773" : "We can't let them down...",
        "59788" : "You mean like some kind of trap...?",
        "59304" : "Th-there are evil brutes everywhere...!",
        "60772" : "The children are all cheering for us!",
        "59787" : "...R-right. It kinda makes it seem like he's waiting for us.",
        "59303" : "Grrr...",
        "60771" : "YOU CAN DO IT, HEROES! WOOOO!!!",
        "60770" : "Thanks a lot, everybody! Let's do it together now, okay? One, two...GO!",
        "59309" : "But... It's dangerous for you to be out and about; you're the one Lupin is here for!",
        "59793" : "We'll just have to bust straight through!",
        "59792" : "And here they are, on cue to block our path...",
        "59795" : "I don't know... But he'd better not think he can go around capturing pretty women!",
        "59311" : "Wha...? At least let us come with you as your bodyguards.",
        "59794" : "Why would Lupin go through all the trouble of impersonating Zenimaru...?",
        "59310" : "I know. I hope he does come for me... In fact, I think I'll go search for Zenimaru by myself!",
        "59791" : "Grrrr...",
        "59790" : "Alright, Master! Let's go full speed ahead and catch ourselves a thief!",
        "60306" : "Well, the story's changed completely thanks to that turnip's spell.",
        "59317" : "...Speaking of which, I think we're surrounded.",
        "60789" : "You'd better be ready to fix this up, or else!",
        "60305" : "Wow, I always wondered what you did after becoming a princess! What a cool story!",
        "59316" : "She's a pretty famous when it comes to thinkers. And her exhibition hall's been taken over by evil brutes...",
        "60788" : "It worked, Master! We pulled Rutabaga out!",
        "60304" : "Yes, just a bit. I apprenticed myself to a certain magician who you might remember from my fairy tale...",
        "59319" : "Stay back, Mitsuyo. I'll handle this.",
        "60787" : "...AGGHH!",
        "60303" : "Ahh, finally a break...\nSo, Cinderella, you know how to use magic?",
        "59318" : "Grrr...",
        "60786" : "Grab on tight, one more time! Heave...ho!",
        "60302" : "...",
        "59797" : "W-wow! I'm never seen Mikazuki fight so hard before!",
        "59313" : "Ah, there you are! I'm so glad to see you're okay!",
        "60785" : "Together, now! One, two...three!",
        "60301" : "Step inside. Then we can have a cup of tea while we exchange proper introductions.",
        "59796" : "And he's in for a surprise if he thinks a bunch of evil brutes can stop me...!",
        "59312" : "...Alright, if you really don't mind. Anyway, let's go find Zenima—",
        "60784" : "Alright! We've got you!",
        "60300" : "WHOA! That pumpkin carriage is more like a pumpkin limousine!",
        "59799" : "...Wait. Are we really sure Doppella is the victim here?",
        "59315" : "...\n...I am the Gates of Hell.",
        "60783" : "I can't pull her out of the ground by myself! Everyone grab onto me and help!",
        "59798" : "I thought I told you—my passion is hot and my resolve is firm! Now let's go!",
        "59314" : "Hey, Mitsuyo! What's the rush? And who's that with you?",
        "60782" : "L-let go! Unhand me this instant!",
        "60781" : "You won't escape me!",
        "60780" : "She's sinking into the ground! How is that even possible?!",
        "59320" : "Don't be silly. I can hold my own in battle just fine.",
        "59322" : "So Gates is...thinking, right? Not just sleeping?",
        "59321" : "...",
        "60309" : "{Username} is the most amazing, super-duper ultimate BEST spirit agent ever to walk the Earth...and also my master!",
        "60308" : "R-right! Sorry for being rude! I'm Sola, from the Bureau of the Occult. And this is {Username}.",
        "60307" : "Now then, may I ask your names as well?",
        "60317" : "Oh...oh, that wouldn't be a proper way to behave in front of Snow White...",
        "59328" : "[Painting Exhibition Area]",
        "60316" : "Hold on! You can't just do whatever the bad guy asks, Cinderella! What are you thinking?!",
        "59327" : "Heh, I'll take that as a compliment.",
        "60799" : "But the heroes saved the day in the end, thanks to all of you! All of us reeeally appreciate your help!",
        "60315" : "Y-yes, of course! It's rude to carry on a conversation from inside the carriage, isn't it? I-I'm coming out right now!",
        "60798" : "Hey, kids! It's Miss Mikado speaking! Sorry about all that scary, spooky stuff!",
        "60314" : "...Found ya! Now get outta that weird carriage and fight me face-to-face!",
        "59329" : "The Gates of Hell may be safe now, but other works of art could still be in danger...",
        "60797" : "Sheesh... Alright, after all that happened I may as well help you out one more time...",
        "60313" : "G-good heavens, I can't believe I'm meeting THE Snow White in person! ...Stay calm, Cinderelly, stay calm!",
        "59324" : "...Thank you very much. You've been a huge help.",
        "60796" : "The spells are finally lifted... We'll leave the finishing touch to you, Mikado!",
        "60312" : "Um, yeah...?",
        "59323" : "Done...! Now the Gates of Hell are 100% safe!",
        "60795" : "...Huh? Everything was so scary a minute ago...now it's fine.",
        "60311" : "WHAT?! You, you're THE Snow White?!",
        "59326" : "And you've got some nerve, to speak like that to me!\n...You haven't changed a bit, either.",
        "60794" : "Eep! Okay, okay, I'll make the scary stories stop!",
        "60310" : "And I'm Snow White. We're trying to solve this catastrophe with the folktale reading machines.",
        "59325" : "You blade hasn't dulled at all, Mitsuyo...and neither has your beauty.",
        "60793" : "Give it up already, Rutabaga. Unless you need some more convincing...\n*cracks knuckles*",
        "60792" : "I shouldn't have pushed myself so hard... Next time I'd better aim for a smaller scare...",
        "60791" : "Mannn, I thought I had plenty of nourishment to spare... Next thing I know, I'm running on empty!",
        "60790" : "Ugh... But I don't wanna use my magic to make people less scared!",
        "59331" : "S-somebody... Help me!",
        "59330" : "Yeah, they might be under attack this very minu—",
        "59333" : "He already ran ahead!\nMikazukiii, you should've waited for us!",
        "59332" : "Well, speak of the devil! Quick, let's...\nHuh? Where'd Mikazuki go...?",
        "60319" : "Ahem...! Please pardon my slip. Now that I understand the situation, I would like to assist you in your task.",
        "60318" : "Please stop acting like that... You're making me uncomfortable...",
        "60328" : "I can't believe we're actually doing this. Glinda, watch over me...",
        "59339" : "That's odd... The Mona Lisa wasn't on the list of artwork scheduled for exhibition.",
        "60327" : "She is rather famous...or infamous. Anyway, let's give it a try.",

        "60325" : "...Let's ask Ridinghood for help. If we can get her on our side...",
        "60324" : "But if we don't fix all the machines at once, her clone monkeys will just change them back...",
        "59335" : "Grrr...",
        "60323" : "So the best approach would be to go around and turn each reading machine back to normal to slowly weaken her.",
        "59334" : "Look, I'm not the type to sit around waiting when I hear a woman scream for help.",
        "60322" : "Ahem! ...Anyway! Those Rutabaga monsters get weaker the more children smile, correct?",
        "59337" : "Tsk... Don't worry, miss, I'm on my way!",
        "60321" : "Y-you don't have to thank ME, Snow White! I-it's the least I can do!",
        "59336" : "H-help me...!",
        "60320" : "Really?! Thank you so much!",
        "59342" : "Has Mikazuki always been like this...? I mean, I know he has a soft spot for the ladies, but still...",
        "59341" : "Hee hee, how kind of you...",
        "59344" : "Have you been hurt, miss? Any injuries?",
        "59343" : "It's a pity he can't control himself around women. Still, his heart's in the right place, and he's not bad in battle, either.",
        "59340" : "Did one of these evil brutes try to lay a finger on you?! Just tell me which one it was and I'll let 'em have it!",
        "60329" : "Alright, everyone! The pumpkin limousine has now arrived at the Little Red Riding Hood Station!",
        "60339" : "...Fine. I don't have the time to waste gettin' angry at you anyway.",
        "60338" : "I-I had no idea! I'm so sorry! Please don't take my pinkies!",
        "59349" : "Wait...what? This is NOT the time for gettin' jiggy with the ladies, Mikazuki!",
        "60337" : "I don't know what else you were expecting...but yes, Ms. Ridinghood here is the leader of a very large gang.",
        "60336" : "The R-Red Gang?! You mean Little...erm, Boss Ridinghood is a gang leader...?",
        "60335" : "That's BOSS Ridinghood to you, got it? I'm the leader of the Red Gang, so show some respect!",
        "59346" : "It's my honor to be able to help a famous beauty like you...",
        "60334" : "Eep! S-sorry!\nUmm...you ARE Little Red Ridinghood, aren't you?",
        "59345" : "I'm fine, thanks... Hee hee. You truly were a big help back there.",
        "60333" : "And who the hell are you supposed to be, talkin' to me so casual...?",
        "59348" : "I'd love to. I feel like you and I could have a quite stunning converation.",
        "60332" : "No, wait...!",
        "59347" : "How gallant, hee hee... Do you think the two of us could sit down, maybe have a coffee...?",
        "60331" : "There she is! Aww, she's like a cute little doll come to life, isn't she?\nHey, Little Red!",
        "60330" : "...",
        "59353" : "Um, Master... Am I the only one getting a really weird feeling about this?",
        "59352" : "Ahh... What a passionate invitation!",
        "59355" : "You heard what she just said to me, right? I can't say no to that!",
        "59354" : "Be careful, Mikazuki, it could be some kind of trap.",
        "59351" : "Hee hee... Come over here with me, Mikazuki...",
        "59350" : "Gettin' jiggy with the ladies? Who even talks like that?",
        "60349" : "I hope you know what you got yourself into, pickin' a fight with me...",
        "60348" : "P-please! Y-you th-think you can intimidate m-m-me?",
        "60347" : "I mow one wave down and another swarms right back. But this time they sleep with the fishes...!",
        "60346" : "Teehee! Once I get you out of the picture, nothing will stop me!",
        "59357" : "So eager! But if you're ready to chat, I—",
        "60345" : "...Come on now, don't hang your head so quickly. It's an insult to your honor.",
        "59356" : "Hee hee... You're so cute. Now hurry up and get over here...",
        "60344" : "I'm very sorry to trouble you...but children are in tears over this! This is serious!",
        "59359" : "Um, what's with the rope? Not that I'm opposed to a little light bondage, but shouldn't we decide a safe word...?",
        "60343" : "Your t-turf...? You mean at the Folktale Fest? Now that you mention it, your reading machine doesn't seem to be affected...",
        "59358" : "Hee hee... Got you.",
        "60342" : "Lend a hand? 'Fraid not. I got no reason to help you, and my hands are already full protectin' my own turf.",
        "60341" : "We're trying to stop a spirit from ruining the Folktale Fest. And we were hoping you might be able to...",
        "60340" : "So what do you want? Lemme guess...you came to ask me a favor?"
